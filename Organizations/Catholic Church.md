### About
What was conceived to just be one of the world's biggest religions is also one of the world's biggest monster purging societies. The lay people know not of the monster world but those of the clergy are each skilled warriors in their own right. The Pope is the leader and fully aware of the threats to the world. Jesus Christ was the first to slay a great demon and found the church as a rock for which monster slayers to build upon. 

The church is split into parishes and each parish is run by a pastor. The pastor secretly trains groups of warriors. Apprentices are chosen out of the youth group. Schools and sermons remain true to the bible and what the church teaches is not said with intent to lie but it is hidden that monsters exist and often are referenced as sin.
