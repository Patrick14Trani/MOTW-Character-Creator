## About
Dimesion 728 is the world as we all know it. The history, cultures, and tech are all that of which we, the players, are familiar. Other than of course... there are monsters. Monsters in this dimension are hidden from the general public. They also normally choose to conceal themselves as technology is quite advanced. However, so are the monsters.

They've adapted and become amazing at hiding among the common rabble. Some have even become aware and achieved the brain power and problem solving of the very humans they sought out to destroy. Even monster hunters have become corrupted and may even fight alongside monsters.
