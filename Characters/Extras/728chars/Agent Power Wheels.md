### Description
A slender built woman with long short brown hair. Has like the emo side swoop over the right side and her hair is dyed red. She normally has a Fischer Price military cap on as well and aviators cover her eyes 24/7

She is extremely untrusting and curious. Often her prying ears get the best of her.
### Notes
The suspiscious Diana Zim found herself a hostage of the KGB after a long year of espionage. She worked heavily with the CIA but switched paths when they refused to save her and pull her out so she ended up being captured. After a long stint in prison she managed her escape and found her way back to [[USA]]. 

She looked for work but nothing filled her like the thrill of danger and luckily one day it found her. She was driving a delivery truck full of toys and was under attack from a small squad of ugly looking creatures. With her personal carry she was able to remove the threats and carry on with her delivery. She took no time observe the targets since she wanted to just get the hell away from any sort of trouble or rader. However, [[Fisher Price]] took a note and found her several days later with a job she couldn't refuse.

After a short while she had proven to be one of the best and was quickly in the running for the greatest mission of all. [[The Coldest Christmas]].
