### About
The Believers are a helpful group up in [[North Dornam]]. They attempt to save who they find and they one day believe they will be strong enough to make a long journey to [[The Crossing]]. Little do they know, the chaos of what's occuring in [[South Dornam]] and little do they realized how safe they are just fighting off the bitter cold.

They currently live in [[Fort Sigmund]] and are lead by the very noble and empathetic [[Chance Ledger]].
