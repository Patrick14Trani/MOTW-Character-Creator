# Date Night Vampire
## Brainstorming
Is this Ready to play: **Kind Of**

This Mission can be played in any city and use any slew of characters. 

The Vampire should appear to be a normal individual.
## The Hook
Several men and women have gone missing or have been found dead. The police were never able to solve the murders since they were distant from one another, however monster hunting P.I. [[Jessica Jones]] found the case files and bodies just in time to send out a distress call to nearby hunters. She is rather busy with another case (A body was found beaten and battered but only tire marks could be found on the corpse).

The hunters will pickup where the police left off.
## The Monster 
- [[Vampire]]:  [[Brady]]  Health (8/8)
## Featured Characters
- [[Jessica Jones]]

## The Mystery
#### Intro
The Players will initially be brought into [[Jessica Jones]] place and specifically to her underground lab where she conducts autopsies. The players will be able to observe the two dead bodies found. one is a man and one is woman.

Evidence to be found on bodies: NOTE - The players should be able to learn, the location, create type, and possible abilities it has... players may do some cool things or have interesting ideas on evidence so improvisation may need to be used heavily.
- Both bodies have two small holes for wounds that are well hidden
- Both have magical traces on them. some investigation and knowledge of magic may reveal it to be a seduction spell. 
- The Man 
	- The man has a gunshot wound to the head
	- Red Hair on him
- The Woman
	- She has 3 gunshot wounds to the chest
	- purple hair on him

There are also case files to be looked over: 
- All victims last know locations were speed dating nights at restaraunts
- All victims had significant blood loss
- Both had unregistered or unknown DNA on their bodies.. whatever it is, its is humanoid and capable of mating with humans. The colored hair on them was different however meaning the culprit may change their appearance.
- The DNA was closely related to DNA found at archaelogical site from several years ago where corpses were discovered with stakes through their chests.
	- Further research on this from the players can reveal that several crypts were empty and some seemed to be missing or recently removed. Two workers were found dead with a good amount of blood drained from each of them.

The players after learning about the date nights will hopefully do some research and find out about the speed date night at [[Skaters]].  Otherwise [[Jessica Jones]] can offer some direction.

#### The Date Night Beginning
[[Skaters]] is somewhat full for the event. The target being a vampire will bring suspicion on several pale individuals, however let it be reminded that makeup exists. The players can attempt to narrow down the heard however they like.

##### **People Present**

**[[Brady]] Siggins (The Vampire)**: About 6ft, makeup can be made out. Blue Hair (Careful examination of this character will reveal he wears a wig). Uses magic to conceal his fangs. Will attempt to seduce a character at somepoint. 

**Jackson Rieger**: around 7ft, in a green trenchcoat and has on a green leprecaun hat. Actually two [[The Fifth Leaf | Fifth Leaf]] members mucking about. *Irish Accent*

**Tim Higgins**: The Douche Chad... very toxic male typa guy. Will only approach female characters.
*Talks like a total Chad*
> 'Insert douch pickup line here.'

**Maddy Son**: The dumb hot blonde. Get's really annoyed when people call her Madison. Should attempt to heavily seduce one of the players. Only goes after the men. She has a little pocket mirror.
*Dumb Blonde voice, valley girl*

**[[Orange Justice]]**: An internet troll. She wears a fortnite Umbra helmet which has a voice filter on it to make *her voice very deep*. She has a thin figure and probably wouldn't be able to tell it was a woman until the mask comes off. She's a memer... and a monster hunter. She gives off magical traces as well.

**[[Heart]]**: A monster hunter who happends to also be a monster hunter. They are a vampire who wants to kill the real vampire. They give off a magical aura similiar to a monster. She is gruff and has no clue how to actually flirt.

**Bob**: The hobo. Comes for the free food and offers really cool stories. People think he's a bit crazy.
#### Speed Dates
There will be a quick segement of 2 speed dates. Players will have been asked to fill out small questionairs and be paired up with 2 npcs or other players for a small bit of rp and investigating based on their answers.

#### After Party / Dates
Characters will hang around the restaruant for free drinks and snacks giving the players a chance to make their final assumption and hopefully deal with the problem. 

The vampire at this time should have a target picked out. It can be a player, npc, whatever. It will certainly use this time to cast seduction and get its target out of here.

#### Fighting the Monster
The Vampire is technically immortal. Cutting it down won't technically kill it. It's up to the players to learn that. To fully kill it, a steak needs to be run through it's heart after it is immoblized.

The Vampire is a deadly and ancient creature capable of killing many. Their powers are quite vast and they are magic users. The players will want to make use of the vampires weaknesses.

## Locations
Can be done in any city, characters will just have to be changed up or new ones made.
Currently setup for [[Dimension729]] in [[Missouri City]].
