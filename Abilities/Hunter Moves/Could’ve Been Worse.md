base class: [[The Spell-Slinger]]

When you miss a **Use Magic** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic:   - **Fizzle**: The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. Youâ€™ll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.
  - **This Is Gonna Suck**: The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.
