# Yasmine

## Description
Yasmine is the only female of the group and also the sassiest. She shines a bright royal blue and stands near as large as Ramu.

## Background
The blue [[Colored Beast]] is found to be the most loved by their followers. She tended to them and cared for them. So in return she is still worshipped and provided for. She rules over them in [[Oramora]]. Her followers are very loyal and she finds herself constantly at odds with [[Galendor's Hand]] who would like to see her dethroned. 

When they had power she was often at odds with [[Ramu]]. They would battle and it only makes sense that their two nations also find themselves at odds in these troubling times.
