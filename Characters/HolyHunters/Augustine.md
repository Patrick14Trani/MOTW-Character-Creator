### Description
Was a meth head lich with a hunger for revenge. His old life left him dying and in need of aid, but no charitable person ever came to him. On the brink of death from an overdose a shadowy figure arrived and saved him. He was told to take back what he was never given. Originally this meant money to Seer and his skeletal body worked at stealing but he soon discovered his ability to create a drug much like what had killed him. It gave him control of people and then he heard of the Sacred Heart. He knew his destiny. He must steal the heart because heart and love was what he was never given.

Now he serves the side of good.
