### Description
A normal looking [[Leprechuan]]. He currently still wears his [[The Fifth Leaf]] outfit.
### Notes
Bucky has been a member of [[The Fifth Leaf]] for 3 years. In those three years he has beaten, murdered, and threatened many a person. He has kidnapped and forced other creatures to do the bidding of his boss. He made some friends in the shady business of magical narcotics. 

Then one day he ran into the [[HolyHunters]]. They killed his buddy and made him re-think his loyalties. He saw a group of people do good and they didnt threaten him, they didn't want to kill him, they gave him a second chance and he's taking it. 

Bucky has two things to battle as a person that the [[HolyHunters]] can help him with.
- They can help to not steal money and shiny things. The players will soon find him to be a rather nusiance of thief and get them into trouble. 
- They also need to help him with a slight drug issue. You don't get into the game without getting hooked.
