# Lucky Charms

## Lore
This is a magical drug created by [[Leprechuan]]. It has the power to completely wipe out any idea of relative sadness as well as remove your ability to physically feel anything. It also inhibits your body much like alchohol and with the slight chance to give you an Irish accent. The effects last 2 hours. The feeling of elated happiness can kill you if you have no magical ability.
