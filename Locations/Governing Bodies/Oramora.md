# Oramora
## *Worshippers of [[Yasmine]]*
## About
When the barriers fell around the land of the mountains, the blue beast [[Yasmine]] was trapped inside here. She was a noble and good god who tended to her people so in this time of need they provided shelter and worship to her. They continue to be at peace with her an although her power is dimmed, she still holds rule over them. The people here do not appreciate the actions of the [[Galendor's Hand]]. In fact they spit and boo at them which leads to tension between Oramora and [[Irustan]].

The country finds itself to be at one with the water on [[Hearth]], and has several islands off the coast which individuals will sometimes explore for fun.
