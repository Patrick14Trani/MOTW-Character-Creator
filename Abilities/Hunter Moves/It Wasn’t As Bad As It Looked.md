Once per mystery, you may attempt to **keep going despite your injuries**. Roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+, heal 2 [[harm]] and stabilize your wounds. On a 7-9 you may either stabilize or heal 1 [[harm]]. On a miss, it was worse than it looked: [[the Keeper]] may inflict a [[harm]] move on you, or make your wounds [[unstable]].
