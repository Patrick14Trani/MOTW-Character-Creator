# DJ Disaster
Ready to be played - **YES**
## Brainstorming
The music is haunted... the DJ brainwashed. The true bad guy is his magically protected turn tables. 

This mission can take place in any city any country. (Europe is far more well known for raves and edm music). It should however be on [[Earth]].

## Hook
The Biggest rave in town is happening and you all know someone who is going... or you're a group of friends going to unwind from previous missions. 

## The Monster
Cursed Turn Tables.... This could have been the result of an overarching big bad or some sort of trickster monster that will have to be killed in another session. The issue at hand is these damn magically turn tables and the seemingly posses DJ.

The Turn Tables are entracing and sucking away the lifeforce of those ensnared to summon a powerful creature... the [[Gloved One]].

Underlings - Backup dancers and possibly zombified dancers.

Mystery Counter = 3 / 10

### Main Dance Room
The main room quite dark however it has all sorts of random illumination from rave lights, lasers, etc. There is a smoke machine billowing out fumes and about 60 + people dance in unison.. Absolute unison.. The DJ on the stage is positioned at some turn tables. The DJ is in a glowing outfit complete with large head dress of a large circle. It is divided into 10 parts and 3 of those parts are lit up. 

Observing the people dancing - The ones in the back will be fine, however the farther up you get, the more hollowed people begin to appear. They become thinner and appear to be fading away. The absolute front couple of rows actually seem undead looking, almost horrifically zombified.
**Spooks or individuals who can see spirits may see an abnormal haze over the crowd, as they get closer they will realized that it's not fog but spirits being ripped from the bodies.**

To the sides of the DJ are stage dancers who are dancing just as the crowd is. They have the same circle symbol as the donned on necklaces. Their eyes appear to be glowing as well.

In the room there are speakers. If the players can't hear music they will notice they may even notice that the speakers aren't even plugged in.

If someone asks what music is playing... casually say its some sort of remix of beat it by michael jackson. If your feeling crazy whip up a whole playlist of remixes and such and don't even mention the music. 

### Bathrooms
#### Mens 
There is a man dancing in seeming unison to the group outside. He has several bleeding wounds.
He appears to be a biker, covered in tattoos and at his hip is an seemingly medieval mace. He appears to be in his 40s and has the handlebar mustache of a god. 

 - If the players search him they will find a very similiar runic disc/necklace in his pocket. 

#### Womens
2 of the stalls are locked and inside each are dead individuals who look a lot like the backup dancers out on the stages right now. 

### Backstage
(If the players just head back here and not stealthily they will be encountered by the back up dancers on the stage after they do some investigating. Suprise attack them.)

A runic symbol burned into the ground can be found along with a spell book. It is written in a strange nonhuman language. It will take some deciphering to learn what it says.

Title of the Spell: "- Ressurection of Gloved One -"
"It's Close To Midnight And Something Evil's Lurking In The Dark  
Under The Moonlight You See A Sight That Almost Stops Your Heart  
You Try To Scream But Terror Takes The Sound Before You Make It  
You Start To Freeze As Horror Looks You Right Between The Eyes,  
You're Paralyzed"

joke: "and then it reads.. on a 10+ the crowd is ensnared in the magical powers of his."

Then next to it is a description and warning of how the spell works and how to dispell it!



### DJ Room
Nothing crazy special here. Some evidence of a frisky time with someone. Drugs can be found by the especially snoopy.
Also his normal DJ head dress can be found here. It's a LLama head with neon lighting setup on the eyes.

### The Bar
The bar also has a multitude of individuals dancing however the barkeep can be seen cleaning glasses and keeping an eye on the door. He too is wearing the symboled necklace. 

## How to stop the ritual?
Either observing the turn tables or reading the spell manual will reveal -

There are 4 runic symbols on each side of the turn tables. Each must be touched with their persepective parts. 

The four runes are all look the same as the DJ's current mask. The ones to be used are around the necks of the 2 background dancers that the players may have fought already. Another around the bar tender's neck. Another around the neck of the bouncer outside. A final one, ripped off of the DJ, in the pocket of the dancing monster hunter in bathroom. 

once all four are touched at the same time the spell dissapates with a resounding shockwave... all stored up souls are returned and basically the party returns to normal.


## If the ritual is not stopped in time
Thriller immediately begins to play and the DJ begins to transform, float, and scream. A brilliant flash of light and a very distinct "HEEEHEEE" from the newely reincarnated Michael Jackson. He dances and the horde of zombies dances in unison to him. 

While doing his dance the players have little time to react before he sends out his zombies to annihilate all other musicians and their fans. 

It's up to the players on this one, there is no technical right answer to this except it is important to note that all those zombified ravers are now actual zombies and there is no saving them really. All of their souls have been combined into one great soul that is MJ. Killing him will remove his hold over all the zombies and they will all collapse.
