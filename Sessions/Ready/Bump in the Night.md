# Bump in the Night
READY TO PLAY: YES
## Brainstorming
A creature of dark manifested in the [[B.D Owens Library]].

## The Hook
Students studying late at night have been found dead 3 nights in a row. The library has shut down and investigations have been going on for weeks but no evidence or leads have been found. The parents are devestated and the library now, a ghost of a building that no one dare enter.

That's really it. There is no story. The creature haunts the top floor of the [[B.D Owens Library]] but after its recent killings it can sort of make it down to the second floow.
