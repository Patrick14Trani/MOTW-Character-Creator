### Description
A well built man with broad shoulders and a seemingly perfect chin. A real chad of an individual if there ever was one. Also bald with very emotionless eyes. Bit of need for nager management but aggression is his main solution and it got him far.
### Notes
Imaginex's actual name is Bif Nolan. He was a stay at home dad when his wife divorced him. He took this as a rebirth and took up working out. He picked up a job as a retail worker at a toy store. 

One day he was unloading a transport truck and came under attack from a rather strange creature. However, rather than run away like the rest, he took it upon himself to fight it. Some urge to prove he wasn't worthless. He killed the creature and was thanked by [[Fisher Price]]. Then offered a position in an interesting part of the company that deal specifically with these strange creatures. Soon... Bif was Agent Imaginex and the head of Imaginex supply defence. Monsters will do anything to ruin happiness and toys tend to be a large part of that. 

Imaginex has done his time and become a veteran among the other agents at [[Fisher Price]] and gone on many solo missions to retrieve merchandise. He has become a master of profit saving and deemed worthy of partaking in possibly the most important mission of them all. [[The Coldest Christmas]].
