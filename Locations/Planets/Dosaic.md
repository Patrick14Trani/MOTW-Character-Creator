# Dosaic
## About
Dosaic is a very Earth like planet featuring oceans, forests, etc. There is a good bit of tectonic activity but overall the planet is a bit more tropical than Earth. 

The planet is home to the [[Jiralhanae]]. They were a divided race that constantly warred with eachother. They had the technilogical feat of space travel but reduced themselves back down to their primal years with nuclear warfare. Then [[The Covenant]] found them.
