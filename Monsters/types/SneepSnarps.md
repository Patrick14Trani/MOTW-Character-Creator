# Hyper Intelligent Animals
## SneepSnarps as Rick calls them
  
**About:** 
  These animals come from [[Dimension48B]]. They are widly intelligent and capable of creating ridiculously powerful things. They also have the ability to spread their knowledge and ideas to animals anywhere else. These animals soon find themselves joining the ranks of the SneepSnarps. They all share a hate for humans normally since in most dimensions humans have control over many animals. 
  
  
**Motivation:** 
  Dimensional domination... free enslaved animals. Begin the revolution
  
**Abilities/Actions/Attacks:**  
Harm: 8 Armor: 2

Other than using whatever tools they have, they have a knack for being able to create whatever they need from things just lying around.
  
**Vulnerabilities**: 
They can't fully overcome their primal urges that evolution has given them. Dogs will still see a ball or squirrel now and then and feel the need to chase.
