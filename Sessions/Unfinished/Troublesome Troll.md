## The Mystery
### The [[Pet Stop]]
Upon arriving at the Pet Stop, an interesting bit of stuff can be found (in fact far more than this mystery needs).

First and most obviously, some huge footprints are in the snow and leading away from the building and into the nearby park.

Inside the store is a whole different story. There are dead animal bodies ([[SneepSnarps]], but the players wouldn't know that term in anyway) and scorch marks and bullet casings, and a good amount of blood. 
- Inspection of the blood would reveal it some of it to be animal and some of it to be human.

There is also a banging and shouting coming from the closet door. Inside is a man who runs the shop. He is very upset and can give a good deal of what happened.

> This dog that could speak came in and turned all the animals.... like smart or sumthin'. They... they tied me up and threw me in here and were talking about taking over the world! I was so scared. Then after about 20 minutes I heard some normal voices and then gunfire!! Wierd laser sounds and actual bullets. One made a small hole in my door so I could see some people killing the animals but then they dissapeared through a some weird green glowing hole and were chasing the first talking dog! THEN a giant weird bigfoot looking creature came in and gave a loud roar. I hid back away and next thing I knew it was smashing through the front of the building. WHAT IN HELL IS HAPPENING???
