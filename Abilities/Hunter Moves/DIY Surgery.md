base class: [[The Wronged]]

When **you do [[quick]] and dirty first aid on someone** (including yourself), roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+ it’s all good, it counts as normal first aid, plus stabilize the injury and heal 1 [[harm]]. On a 7-9 it counts as normal first aid, plus one of these, your choice:   - Stabilise the injury but the patient takes -1 [[forward]].
  - Heal 1-[[harm]] and stabilise for now, but it will return as 2-[[harm]] and become [[unstable]] again later.
  - Heal 1-[[harm]] and stabilise but the patient takes -1 [[ongoing]] until it’s fixed properly.
