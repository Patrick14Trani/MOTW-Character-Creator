# Nalau
## *The Purple Beast's hiding place*
## About
Nalau is a dangerous marshy swampland. The people here are strange and have an above average understanding of the magical arts. The creatures in this mystical and secretive swampland are equally as magic and unique. This is the land that the purple [[Colored Beast]] was trapped in but no one has seen him since.

This country is the most mystical on [[Hearth]] as well as the least visited. Even [[Galendor's Hand]] has to work up the courage to come here.
