# The Initiate

> Since the dawn of history, we have been the bulwark against Darkness. We know the Evils of the world, and we stand against them so that the mass of humanity need not fear. We are the Flame that cleanses the Shadows.

### What's Unique
- **Sect**: You are the initiate of a sect and you get to create what that sect it. You'll need to think about - Where are they from? How old are they? Are they religious? Why do they stay secret? How do they recruit?

	And then you need to pick some traditions
	
- **Initiate special**: When you spend a point of Luck, something goes wrong for your Sect: an ill-advised project or a disastrous operation.
