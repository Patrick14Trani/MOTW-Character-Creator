## Capital to the Empire 

## About
**Solitude** is the capital city of both Haafingar Hold, and all of [[Skyrim]]. Currently ruled by Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, it is the headquarters of the [[Imperial Legion]] stationed in Skyrim. General Tullius commands the Imperial army from the stone-walled Castle Dour, while Solitude's Jarl, Elisif, resides in the Blue Palace. The [[Thalmor]] have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains.
