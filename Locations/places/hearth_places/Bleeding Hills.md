# Bleeding Hills
## *[[Lucas]]'s Retreat*

## About
A large portion of the geography in [[Adastan]] is the Bleeding Hills. Farmers tend to keep livestock and some plant crops in this area. The scarlet light from the mountains finds it's way down to the hills and creates the bleeding look on the crops. Legend has it that the brighter the light, the worse the crops will be.
