# Utopia
## The *Perfect* Place

## About
Utopia is a large city found on [[Kyrde]], [[Zeneth]]. Utopia is ruled over by the [[Utopian Court]]. These individuals run the entire lives of the inhabitants which many don't mind because the rules aren't that bad and the [[Z-Virus]] has never touched the lands. 

The city is policed by [[The Pure]] and runs seeminly strict rules such as a curfew and random house checks for illegal goods which would be anything not distributed by [[The Pure]]. CItizens don't have to work, robots do most manual labor and [[The Pure]] deal with everything else. In fact the only job one can have would be to join [[The Pure]]. Doing so is also the only way to escape the borders of [[Kyrde]].
