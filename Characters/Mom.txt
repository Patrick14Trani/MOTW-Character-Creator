Moves:
   Boss from Beyond: At the beginning of each
	mystery, roll +Weird. On a 10+, your Superiors ask
	you to do something simple. On a 7-9, they ask you
	to do something complicated or difficult. In either
	case, you get to ask them one of the questions from
	the investigate a mystery move right now. On a
	miss, you are required to do something terrible. If
	you do not accomplish what they’ve ordered, you
	cannot use this move again until you have made up
	for your failure.
   Soothe:When you talk to someone for a few
	seconds in a quiet voice, you can calm them down,
	blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emotions they have. This works even if the thing that
	freaked them out is still present, as long as your
	voice can be heard.
   Lay On Hands: Your touch can heal injury and
	disease. When you lay your hands on someone
	hurt, roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2 harm or an illness,
	plus they’re stabilized. On a 7-9, you can heal the
	harm or illness as on a 10+, but you take it into yourself. 
	On a miss, your aura causes them extra harm.
