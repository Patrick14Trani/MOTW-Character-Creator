base class: [[The Flake]]

At the beginning of each mystery, if **you look for the wider patterns** that current events might be part of, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. Spend your hold during the mystery to ask the Keeper any one of the following questions:   - *Is this person connected to current events more than they are saying?*
  - *When and where will the next critical event occur?*
  - *What does the monster want from this person?*
  - *Is this connected to previous mysteries we have investigated?*
  - *How does this mystery connect to the bigger picture?*
