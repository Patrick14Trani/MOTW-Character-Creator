As long as you carry a personal object belonging to someone, such as a lock of hair, a full set of toenails, or a treasured family heirloom, you get +1 ongoing to **Use Magic** against them. You can also **Use Magic** against them at a distance. If you try to **Use Magic** against them and miss, the token is lost, destroyed, or loses its power.
