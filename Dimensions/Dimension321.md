# Dimension 321
### Land of Centaurs
---
## About
Dimesion 321 to a human would be the equivalent of taking acid and LSD simultaniously. Every creature there is a an animal combined with a horse. EVERY ANIMAL. There aren't even really normal centaurs. 

The land even appears to be animated. Everything there looks like a real life cartoon. The place is one hell of a fever dream. 

The place is full of whimiscal magic and mystery. The prescence of magic incites the prescense of those who would master it. Shamans exist and control bits of the magic and each have their take on an aspect of the world.

Staying in this land too long could render you becoming an animated being.
