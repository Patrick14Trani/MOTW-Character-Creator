# We're not in Kansas Anymore
**Ready for play? : Yes**
## Brainstorming
SO basically... a portal or person.. probably rick... will send the players to [[Dimension729]].  Utterly important that the players no nothing about that place. 

This may be less of a mystery and really heavy on combat.

The idea of this session is to display a bunch of different places in the world and give those players a chance at the end to choose where their next session will be.

## The Hook
The Heroes have heard rumor that a local petshop has received an anonymous package and that the creature is something the shopkeep has never seen before. [[UCMG]] were sent onto the scene immediatly to control spread of word but nothing bas been hear of them. They sent out a word for local monster hunters to help.

or

The players receive a mysterious call from a nearby telling them to come to the [[Pet Stop]] in Kansas City. The call will somewhat obviously be from [[Rick Sanchez]] and [[Morty]].

> Heeyyy finally someone answered. Look you should come on down to [[Pet Stop]] monster hunter. Oh and bring some friends! Got a bit of a problem I could use your expertise on. 
> Riick? Why are you doing that kiss ass thing?
> Idk, these hero types tend to have a praise kink right? Anyway! Ya.. you should come on over! This is like... nearly an avengers level threat.

## The Mission Playout
### Intro
The Players will arrive at [[Pet Stop]] to find the smoldering corpses of two [[UCMG]] agents as well as [[Rick Sanchez]] sitting behind the counter! Also an uncomfortable amount of animal corpses lying on the ground, however at all their paws lay futuristic looking blasters. On the counter specifically is what appears to be a dead parrot. 

> "Took you all long enough! These tools didn't listen to me and now look at them. I don't really have time for this whole quest so I'm going to dump it on to all of you ..."

Rick will give the downlow on [[SneepSnarps]] and how they are hell bent on dimensional domination. One of them got away through a dimensional portal and Rick wants you all to chase it down and prevent it from getting away. 

Luckily the portal technology is pretty rudimentary and the portals remain open for awhile. Rick will give you a [[Portal Closer]].  

> "I cannot stress this to you enough! If that SneepSnarp get's control over a world that isn't nearly as advanced as this one.. It will fall, and the whole galaxy in that universe will be consumed by ravaging SneepSnarps... or something like that. Anyway Go! Go! go fucking kill it. I don't want ravaging rabbits that are as smart as me... can you imagine what would happen to rule 34! Animals are fucked up guys... fuuuucked up!"

And he will attempt to push the players toward the open portal. 

Note: The players may not trust Rick. This will be the que for [[Morty]] to enter. He will come in and beg for Rick to hurry up and see you guys. He'll assure them that the quest is very real and he knows how you feel right now but if they truly don't help, huge horrible things will probably happen.

> "Rick doesn't waste his time on anything that couldn't be detrimental to the galaxy."

### [[Dimension729]] on [[Earth]]
The players teleport to a [[Pet Stop]] just like the one they were just in, only minus the corpses and plus  evil animals. They will immediatly find themselves under laser fire from a squad of lizards. Behind the register, emptying out money, is a dog. The dog is standing on his back two legs and is wearing mechanical gloves that give it normal hangs allowing it to interact with stuff. It sees you all and teleports away. 

> The amount of lizards and enemies can vary based on how many people you have playing and how strong they are.

After the combat.. banging can be heard from the storage closet. The shop keep is bound and gagged in there. He is in absolute shock and rants about how he just want's to go the [[Missouri City]] Natives game.

Availible loot / clues:
[[Laser Gun]]

The lizards are real lizards, however if possible from someone to magically investigate them it can be seen that this is no kind of magic. They truly are just becoming hyper intelligent.

The front door hasn't been touched. 

### [[Dimension728]] on [[Nirn]]
The next portal takes the players onto a very cold mountain. Up the mountain they can see a large ancient looking temple (It is [[High Hrothgar]]). From down below they can hear a roar. They are extrememly high up so the monster couldn't have really gone down the side or up at all. 

**Up**:
If the players go toward the temple they can enter it. If any of them are avid gamers they will recognize this place. Inside they will be greeting by the [[Greybeards]]. However they will not introduce themselves as such. The players may ask if they saw the [[SneepSnarps]] come through. 

Soon enough someone will crash into the building and the greybeards will go to check it out.

**Down**: 
The players will descend the mountain to see a man running for his life from a [[Troll]]. The troll seeing new targets will engage you all. If the running man gets dragged into the combat, he will attempt to use his thuum. 

Killing the Troll will give you the ability to talk with the stranger. Then you'll all probably make your way to the Temple.

**In the Temple**: 
The [[SneepSnarps]] is currently hiding in the backyard taking a breath. The players will catch it off guard giving them a chance to act on it and start a fight if they wish. Once it feels it is losing, it will teleport away.

As for other stuff in the temple. Several of the Greybeards are milling about doing their thing. Once the dragon born enters they'll rave about him for a bit but they wont start their work with him until they have helped you.

In the living quaters there is a spell book

Availible loot / clues:
- Dragon Born blood will give someone the ability to learn the thuum.
- [[Flame Atronach Spellbook]]

### [[Dimension666]] in [[Demonia]]
The players will find themselves in a warehouse. They won't know it but this warehouse is under the control of the [[DBI]]. The players will see several figures in suits talking with the possibly wounded target. 

It is at this point conflict can greatly arise. The players will realize that those individuals are not people and are actually demons. The demons will be absolutely shocked to see humans. The [[SneepSnarps]] will take advantage of this and attemp to run off into the warehouse.

Turns - 
- After first combat turn, the SneepSnarp will have found a crate of things to work with
- after second turn it will have crafted half of the item it is making
- after the thir combat, if it has not been engaged yet, it will leap into the midde of the fray shooting its newly crafted laser machine gun.
	- This attack will do 2 harm to all targets that fail an act under pressure.
	- [[Machine Laser Gun]](4 harm, obvious, cover piercing, ignore armor, heavy)

After the initial blast.. players might need to be reminded that they are in a warehouse full of boxes and other large objects that they can hide behind. 

Around the warehouse are explosives that can be tossed, a [[Gravity Hammer]], and some futuristic medkits.

Players can attempt to open boxes or do whatever, but making too much noise or showing themselves will result in a laser volley being sent at them. 
The [[SneepSnarps]] will roll to attack in that case. 

After 4 volleys, its gun will jam giving the players an opening. The [[SneepSnarps]] after the initial attack will attempt to create a portal. It must make a roll, on an even it creates the portal and on an odd it doesnt work.

If it by chance creates and gets to the portal.. the players will be teleported to [[Blood Gultch]] on [[Etran Harborage]].

### [[Dimension117]] on [[Etran Harborage]]
Assuming the creature has been heavily wounded, it will be bleeding out in the middle of this canyon. They're are small hills all around. The view from where they enter gives them sight on two bases, one on each side of the canyon. Movement can definetly be seen. 

The [[SneepSnarps]] will attempt to beg for its life.

### Outro
Once the creature is killed [[Rick Sanchez]] will appear to congragulate you and he will take up the body.

> Well done... honestly though I was going to be taking home more bodies. No offense. Welp... cool. Maybe see you fucks someplace else

Rick will create them a portal where ever they want to go. Or the players can stay here and the session will end.
