suburbs. Needed money and wanting to be able to face that scary stuff I took a job hunting it down.

Professional special: When you spend a point of Luck,
your next mission from the Agency comes with lots of
Red Tape. Lots.

Moves:
	Deal with agency: , requesting help or
		gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On
		a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a
		7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out
		by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get
		what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed
		up: you might be suspended or under investigation,
		or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to
		get any help until you sort it all out
	Battlefield Awareness:You always know what’s
		happening around you, and what to watch out for.
		Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever
		you get from your gear
	Mobility: Black Mercedes AMG C-Class Sedan (Fast, intimidating, obvious)
	Unfazeable: Take +1 cool
	Tactical Genius: When you read a bad situation,
		you may roll +Cool instead of +Sharp
