# The Grand Docks
## Gateway to Hell

## About
The only set of docks left on [[Kyrde]] in which large enough ships can be stored to reach [[South Dornam]]. Here [[The Pure]] will prepare for launching supplies and troops to [[Helper's Harbor]]. Often civilians will attempt to sneak on ships to escape the insanely boring life not realizing how horrid the world is elsewhere.
