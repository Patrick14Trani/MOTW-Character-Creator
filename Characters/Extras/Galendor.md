### Notes

Galendor lived during the dark ages when [[The Dark One]] and [[The Light One]] would often do battle. He was lucky to live in the land of light with a nice family but he always struggled to accept his life when others couldn't experience anything like him.

He left his home against his parents will and set out to explore [[Hearth]]. Park of the dark lands contained [[Nalau]] which revealed much mystical ways to Galendor. He learned the magic arts and practiced and practiced. He became a strong magic wielder which soon drew the eye of [[The Dark One]]. Galendor was forced to flee back to his land of [[Oramora]]. He was able to reveal all he had learned and his plan to his parents before they died.

A couple more years of studying lead to him meeting [[The Light One]]. He studied it and was able to come up with magical ways to subdue the [[Colored Beast | Colored Beasts]]. 

Eventually he was ready to attempt to subdue the lord of darkness. An army was gathered and they charged. Galendor lead the attack into the dark lands and they would achieve victory over the dark one and locking him away in a volcano in the [[Scarlet Mountains]].  

Galendor lived out the rest of his life studying and passing on his knowledge to a new order he refered to as [[Galendor's Hand]]. He told them to remain secretive and out of the way. Dedicated your lives to watching the [[Colored Beast]]. Never let the dark one rise again and subdue any more if the need be.

Galendor died a hero of the land.
