### Notes
  Heart was a woman who had abandoned civilization and society. She prefered the quite life and living rough. She lived in a small camsite far off the grid were no agency would ever find her, no person would ever lay eyes on her, and no dollar could ever corrupt her. She lived happily with animals and nature. Until one day she awoke to a figure standing over her. Defenseless she was the victim of a vampire attack and barely survived. She tracked the vampire back into civilization and killed it. But her heart had changed and rather than going back to her habitat she worked her way back into society and made it her mission to kill every vampire she ever crossed. Being part vampire herself... she wanted no one to feel the agony that she does and no one to be stripped of their peace. 
  
  She will not kill anything other than vampires for they have not wronged her and as far as she is concerned they are apart of nature.
