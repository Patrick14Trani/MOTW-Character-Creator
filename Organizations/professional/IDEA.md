### About
This organization monitors all interdimensional entities and has taken it upon themselves to put a stop to all universe ending threats. They only hire the best of the best and keep their eyes on all propective canidates. 

They do not bat an eye at small threats and leave that to the normal monster hunters across the dimensions. They may not even lift a finger to deal with world ending threats. *Nature must run it's course.*

Their units wear a mix of orange and baby blue armor sets and have access to all sorts of futuristic tech. The organization promotes compeition and heavily rewards its succesful units. They are even known to challenging canidates in secret tournaments to find replacements of substitutes for dead or failing teams.
