# The Chosen

> Your birth was prophesied. You are the Chosen One, and with your abilities you can save the world. If you fail, all will be destroyed. It all rests on you. Only you.

### What's Unique
- **Fate**: You get to choose what sort of fate is in store for your character. You get to choose how you found out and then some Heroic tags and Doom tags. These tags will help the game master come up with scenarios for your fate!
- **Special Weapon**: As a Chosen, you get a custom designed weapon.
- **Chosen Special**: When you spend a point of Luck, the Keeper will bring your fate into play.
