# Crafty Cane

## Lore
This cane was developed and build by [[Brick Boston]] in his earlier years as a monster hunter. He created it to detain monster and yet to also be something that the public wouldn't find strange to see a person holding. The cane has several switches under the crook and one at the base. These switches each trigger a mechanism useful for detaining monsters. 

The cane itself looks wooden but is actually a light, but extremely durable metal. 

## Abilities
- Taser Switch: This switch is the first one under the crook and when pushed it allows the handle to be detached. Once detached two metal prongs are revealed and the handle serves as a taser would. Taser (1-harm, incapicate, close). The rest of the cane can be used as a club.
- Sonic Blast: The second switch under the crook, when pressed, reveals a speaker system which fires off a piecing blast forward. With study, the pitch was chosen as one only monsters can hear. The sound will briefly dissorient any monster. 
- Recording: A third switch allows the cane to record nearby sounds and capture video with a forward facing camera. Makes it great
