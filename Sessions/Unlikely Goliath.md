# Unlikely Goliath
**Ready for play? : No**
## Brainstorming
A scientist is upset that his cat has no arms... He attempts to grow them back but the growth concoction he created takes effect to the whole body and the little cat turns into a gigantic T-Rex Cat. It is confused, trashes the small town once called home and begins to make it's way towards a city.

- The scientist has an idea of how to make a chemical that will shrink it back down to size.
- The military has a very brute force idea to the problem, but revealing a weak point is going to have to happen first.
