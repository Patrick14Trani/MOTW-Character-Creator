# Fort Skyhaven
## Impenatrable wills and walls

## About
The fortress of [[Sky Warriors]], led by [[Melissa Carter]], is on one of the snowy mountains of [[North Dornam]]. They live for themselves and becoming new members is extremely hard to do. With no friends and many enemies, they have little self supply. Being on a mountain though, makes the fort extremely hard to attack in cold conditions. They have perfect view of the [[The Crossing]] and will often raid groups attempting to reach South Dornam.
