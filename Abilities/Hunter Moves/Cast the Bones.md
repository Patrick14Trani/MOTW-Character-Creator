Once per mystery, you may perform some kind of divination (tarot, casting the runes, reading entrails, or something like that) to glean information about the future. When you seek guidance by divination, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+, [[hold]] 2. On a 7-9, [[hold]] 1. On a miss, you get some information, but itâ€™s not what you want to hear. Spend those holds to ask any question from the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** move, or one of the following questions:
- What can I gain from this person/place/thing/creature?

- Who has touched this person/place/thing/creature before me? [[The Keeper]] will answer truthfully, with either a direct answer or how to find out more.
