## About
Dimension 666 is a very opposite take on the universe. Monsters roam the Earth and have a collection of countries and political systems. Their issue are much the same as what we deal with today only... their monsters. Humans lurk in the shadows and strike when they can! In fact most of the demons lurking about don't even believe in humans at all.
