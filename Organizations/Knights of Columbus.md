### About
This is a sect within the [[Catholic Church]]. Since the church is so massive it created multiple other sects that adhere it's policy as well as their own newer ones. 

The Knights serve as a great place for the men of the Catholic faith to gather and grow in their faith together. Friends can be made and activities can be held. At least that's what they tell people. If you're in it long enough you become trained in the monster hunting ways. These knights serve as a standing guard to the churches they meet at.
