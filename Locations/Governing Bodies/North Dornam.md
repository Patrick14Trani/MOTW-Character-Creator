# North Dornam
## *Land of the rotting flesh*
## About
North Dornam is the starting point of the [[Z-Virus]] and the northern most continent on [[Zeneth]]. North Dornam is a cold and frigid land at the top. As you move south through the continent it remains cold but with scattered Tiaga forests and frozen over rivers.

Currently a few hardened individuals have created a way to live in these lands. Some are still hopeful that the other continents will eventually save them while others have completely given up and do what they can to keep on living. They even hope somedays that they will be able to get revenge on those that abandoned them.
