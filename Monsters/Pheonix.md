# Pheonix 
  
**About:** The supposed mythilogical, immortal, fiery bird that is one that many can't see anymore. In a lot of dimensions, they've died out. Turns out that killing them isn't all that hard.

However, they aren't really a violent creature. They don't seek out to kill others. They enjoyed flying in the sky feeding off the suns rays but monster hunters in developing worlds decided that they were like any other monster and needed to be kept from the public. Also their ashes made for interesting trophies to some. 
  
**Motivation:** To literally just exist and be a cool symbol. They big chillin.
  
**Abilities/Actions/Attacks:**  
- Peck (2-harm, burn)
- Explode for 4-harm when killed. 
  
**Vulnerabilities**: 
No sunlight, if the ashes can't be touched by the sun then they can't recreate themselves into several baby birds.
