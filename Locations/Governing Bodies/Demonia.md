# Demonia
## Safe Haven for Monsters

## About
Demonia is a country on Earth in [[Dimension666]]. It is a capatalistic democracy found in North Badland. The capital of the country is [[The Gates]] which houses the portal to hell through which demons maay emerge. 

Demons are not allowed without proper documentation.

Some example laws that citizens must follow are:
- No opening of unregistered portals
- No illegal haunting of anothers property
- No senseless killing
- Practices of [[Satanism]] are allowed
- Demons or monsters entering boarders must have proper documentation
	- Without proper documentation, you will be sent to hell.
- No illegal harboring of humans
- Possesion of unregistered holy items is illegal

The current political issues in Demonia are:
- Demons wishing to make the place more like hell. Legalize [[Satanism]]
- Everyone should be allowed to get holy items. Self defence is paramount in a place threatened by [[Satanism]].
- Undocumented demons
- lack of jobs currently due to companies outsourcing to cheaper labor in other countries
