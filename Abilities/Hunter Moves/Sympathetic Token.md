As long as you carry a personal object belonging to someone, such as a lock of hair, a full set of toenails, or a treasured family heirloom, you get +1 [[ongoing]] to **[[Use Magic]]** against them. You can also **[[Use Magic]]** against them at a distance. If you try to **[[Use Magic]]** against them and miss, the token is lost, destroyed, or loses its power.
