# Revenant
  
**About:** 
A revenant is a reanimated corpse that has been revived to haunt the living. Revenants can have specific targets based off of what wronged them in their previous life. Once all their targets are killed within the area they calm and haunt the area they were brought back in. After long enough the calm will dissapate and whoever enters the place next becomes the new target or targets.
  
**Motivation:** 
To kill their targets. Kill. Kill. Kill.
  
**Abilities/Actions/Attacks:**  
Revenant Speed: When a target is in view the revenant moves at double to speed becoming much harder to hit and definetly harder to get away from.

Revenants Gouge: If the revenant has not chosen a weapon, it will attempt to rip it's targets apart. Its hands deal 2-harm and have the chance to paralyze it's targets in fear.
  
**Vulnerabilities**:  
Smudge Sticks - A ghost hunting tool that can scare the ghost away when lit. This can give you a chance to break line of site and hide.
