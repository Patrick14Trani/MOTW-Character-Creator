### Description
A fun lighthearted individual. The rules and procedures of his company don't hold him back and he does what he can to support the players. However, if the players fail - he will be held accountable. Too many times and he may get fired.
### Notes
An agent working for the [[UCMG]]. He works closely with third party hunting groups, providing ground support as well as information to agents when they need it. He is based in [[Massachusetts]] and is close to retirement.

Dylan has a rather large family in [[Aurora]] and hopes to retire back to them soon.

In one of his, surely, final escapades. He requisitioned a helicopter for the [[HolyHunters]] in [[Holly Bluff]] and attacked the [[The Fifth Leaf]].  The helicopter was not of [[UCMG]] property and rather a locals helicopter. His actions would be reported and he would recieve a badge of honor for taking it upon himself to attempt a daring capture. However, he would be a bit scolded for not capturing a [[Leprechuan]].
