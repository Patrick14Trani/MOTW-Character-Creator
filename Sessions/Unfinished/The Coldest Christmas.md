# The Coldest Christmas

## Brainstorming
- Hereos are slowly introduced to who they are hunting.
- They are given the choice to hunt him or switch to another target.
- Having a problematic agent with them 

## The Hook
A wealthy organization ([[Fisher Price]]) has reached out to a monster hunting agency to hire a group of monster hunters to put a stop to a monster that threatens all of Christmas!

ooorrrr....

The group has passed a recent challenge that [[Fisher Price]] presented them and have been chosen for the special mission.

## The Session
### Intro: Arriving at [[Fisher Price HQ]]
Arriving at the HQ will result in a very serious escort into an underground facility. Walking through a series of halls and corridors they will eventually arrive at a viewing room looking over a large facility. 

The Room there are looking over is rather large and has a lot of individuals in lab coats running about. In the middle of the room is a large metal cirular device and around that are a group of hooded individuals drawing runes. On the far side is a red skinned humanoid in a suit ([[Demon]]), chained to a metal crucifix.
> This is our portal chamber... you have all been brought here to pull off possibly one of the greatest monster hunts on [[Earth]]. More information will be revealed to you about your target when you go through that portal... IF.. you go through that portal. I will be honest... this is extremely experimental and the odds of being able to come back are slim. But we will be doing the universe a service. That being said, if we do make it back the reward will be unsermountable. 
> If no. we will have you escorted from the premises and be on your way

With that quick sentiment.. the players must decide if they are willing to take the leap.
- If they say yes, perfect we can continue, Keep in mind we want to persuade them heavily to do the mission. If they have outstanding debt or beef with an organization it can be offered to have that removed. Otherwise fame, fortune, a new base addition or base in general. Travel to anywhere... etc..
- If they say no for some reason... then they will be removed from the premisses but on the way over a 
	- Before their memories can be wiped, [[Rick Sanchez]] will portal to them, blast the two agents and yell at you to hurry in. Alarms begin to blare!
		> RICK! you totally just killed thay guy!
		> Shut up Morty! Guys guys get in!! I accidentally forgot to switch to stun... This is the only way out!

		Skip to the where are we part!

### If they agreed!
The agent with you will speak into an earpiece and in will come in a couple of people. 
The first is [[Mary Weihnachten]] and she is followed by [[Agent Power Wheels]]. The original agent will then introduce the group and herself as [[Agent Imaginex]]. The Agents will leave for a quick second giving some roleplaying opportunity to interact with [[Mary Weihnachten]]. If they don't interact with her she'll start asking about them so they can introduce themselves a bit. 

Then the agents will come back after a bit and the playes will follow them out into the giant room. The cloaked individuals will be all be circled around the circle of runes. One will be standing waiting to greet the team and motion for them to enter the circle. Two lab coat individuals will begin to sprinkle dust around the edges while another two wheel the figure on the crucifx over. The lead man will draw a sacraficial dagger. With the go ahead the ritual will commence. If the players have any last statements or questions they can do so!

Big Magic Portal: You will go ahead and roll for the ritual casters:
- On a 12+:  They appear at the exit from the tunnels into the Workshop grounds
- On a 10+: They appear in a room near the exit
- On a 7-9: They appear in the torture chamber
- On a Fail: They appear on an ice slide down towards the waste disposal

### The Ice Caves
The players will portal into an icy cave (It will be part of a cave network under [[Santa's Workshop]]). Depending on the roll beforehand, will decide where they end up. Their goal will be to find a way to the surface. 

The actual tunnels themselves are quite large in some parts. A main tunnel which is large enough for a large truck to drive through. In fact their are like spiked treads, scratching in the tunnel which seem to run the length of the tunnel.

Depending on where they teleport to the Agents will reveal to the players where they are, and their purpose.
> Alright... we should be in domain of the enemy. Your guy's objective to make sure we reach the target and take them out. We cannot reveal that information yet but they are known as the enemy of Christmas.

#### Waste Disposal
The waste disposal area seems to be the end of a large tunnel. It very steeply drops off into a very dark, seemingly bottomless pit. 

If the players teleport here, they should teleport onto the steep icy slide down into the abyss. It will be up to them to figure out how to save themselves.
Hint: Bladed Weapons/ Magic can be good ways to stop themselves from falling and then some tough checks to climb up.

At the very top of the slide are ice climbing tools in a "Break in Case of Emergency" Box as well as a harness/ rope for climbing down the side. Next to the emergency box is also a phone that has specific buttons for dialing specific rooms as well as the classic 9 digit set. 

#### Torture Chamber
A room with an assortment of torture tools and a lot of dried, presumably blood, on the floor. However the blood has a green shade to it. On the torture table currently is a small dog. It looks beaten and broken. A truly horrid site. A high tech device can be seen attached to its throat and surely enough it awakes and can speak.

The players don't know it but this dog is [[The Grinch]]'s dog (It is a [[SneepSnarps]]). It will beg to be freed and have them help it escape. The agents will highly recommend that we just keep moving or the creature be put down. Mary will more so be disturbed and confused. She'll focus on the room itself.

If this is the room they teleport to, then the Agents Can reveal a bit about their purpose and target.

What is hidden here: Hidden here is a hatch above, however there is seemingly no way to climb up to it/ open it. It is protected by magic. If the players find a way to open it then they will find themselves in a sleeping barracks of [[Worker Elves]].

#### Beast Chambers
The beast chambers are a collection of snow related creatures from all sorts of dimensions. Each is kept in its own pen with several others. It's basically a giant snow themed zoo. There isn't much to find here but all over the place are phones and maps of the zoo area. It can be found that there is actually an exit on one side and they happened to enter through a service tunnel of sorts.

#### Warhead Storage
This room is a hidden room in an outlet in the middle of the tunnel. It can be found with a good investigation question, a code, a keycard, and finally a retinal scan.

Inside is a large storage room housing all sorts of explosives and most importantly a nuclear warhead. This room has direct access to the fortress above as well as a large door that presuably allows things to be flown in.
