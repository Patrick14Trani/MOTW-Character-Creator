## About
Blood Gultch is a canyon found on [[Etran Harborage]]. There are two bases on either side of the canyon and each are occupied by human spartan forces who have been tasked with defending their flags from one another.

One end of the canyon touches a large ocean and the other is pushed up against a closed in cave.
