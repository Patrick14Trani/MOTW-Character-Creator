# The Crossing
## Bridge to Beyond

## About
The Bridge serves as a connecting point between [[North Dornam]] and [[South Dornam]].  Before the zombie outbreak this bridge would serve as a way for cars to get between the two continents. 

Survivors that make it to the crossing have to deal with bandits and nasty individuals of all types. The zombies infest the openings on both ends of the bridge but they if you make it across, your chances of survival increase 10 fold.
