base class: [[The Spell-Slinger]]

When you miss a **[[Use Magic]]** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the [[magic]]:   - **Fizzle**: The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You’ll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.
  - **This Is Gonna Suck**: The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.
