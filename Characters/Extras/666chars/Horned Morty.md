### Description

### Notes
Horned morty is a dimensional counterpart to [[Morty]].  He is the current director of [[DBI]] in [[Dimension666]] on the planet [[Earth]].

His story starts with as most [[Rick666]] and Morty adventures begin, Rick wanting to do something crazy. This time Rick666 wanted to see if Hell was real. He wanted to prove to Morty that it made no sense for things to exist beyond the Dimensional time and space. However to his utter shock he opened a portal to Hell and in the chaos of monsters consuming all, Morty was taken by demons. 

This morty was beaten, tortured, and introduced to a blood concoction that turned him into a demon. Horned Morty has no regard for human life and has a goal of bringing down the uncle that abandoned him. 

To do this he helped establish [[Demonia]] and the [[DBI]]. However with the current war he has been forced to wage on [[Satanism]], he finds himself having to take a long break from his vision and reastablish power to his country. He is currently attempting to run for President of Demonia and looking for a replacement in his role should he be successful.
