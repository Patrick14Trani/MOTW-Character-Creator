**At the beginning of each mystery**, roll +Weird. On a 10+, your Superiors ask you to do something simple. On a 7-9, they ask you to do something complicated or difficult. In either case, you get to ask them one of the questions from the **Investigate A Mystery** move right now. On a miss, you are required to do something terrible. If you do not accomplish what theyâ€™ve ordered, you cannot use this move again until you have made up for your failure.
