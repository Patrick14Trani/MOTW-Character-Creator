The Sect has ancient prophecies or divination techniques to predict the future. Once per mystery, you may use them. If **you look at what the future holds**, roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 3, and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1. On a miss, you get bad information and [[the Keeper]] decides how that affects you. Spend your [[hold]] to:   - have a [[useful]] object ready.
  - be somewhere you are needed, just in time.
  - take +1 [[forward]], or give +1 [[forward]] to another hunter.
  - retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesn’t happen.
