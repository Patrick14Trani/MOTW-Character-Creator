# Revenant
  
**About:** 
A revenant is a reanimated corpse that has been revived to haunt the living. Revenants can have specific targets based off of what wronged them in their previous life. Once all their targets are killed within the area they calm and haunt the area they were brought back in. After long enough the calm will dissapate and whoever enters the place next becomes the new target or targets.
  
**Motivation:** 
To kill their targets. Kill. Kill. Kill.
