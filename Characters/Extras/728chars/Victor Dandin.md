### Notes
On a vacation to [[England]] with his family, a [[gargoyle]] attacked them all on a walk through the city and immediatly crushed his wife and child. It swatted him away into the wall and knocked him unconscious and it was this that probably saved him.

For the next couple of years he battled whether he was insane and was institutionalized for ranting about how a creature killed his family. The public believed they were just hit with a vehicle but of course the cuplrit was never found. 

In his time through [[Shadow Falls Sanitarium]] he made a couple of troubled friends and even met those who had gone through what he had. Of course no one believed them, but he did. He rallied a couple of them together and hatched a plan to escape the sanitarium. They discovered how to summon one of their deceased inmated back as a [[revenant]].    

The revenant went about killing all it could within the building. Mainly guards since they were the evil of the his past life. This gave about the chaos needed to escape and so he did. Victor was not proud of summoning an evil creature and killing but he knew it was for the better of mankind.

Under a new alias, he and his new buddies created [[Blitz Co]]. An undercover monster hunting organization that is fronted by a sports supply store. With his knew found power and substantial income, he met with monster hunters back in England to find the gargoyle that killed his family. After months of searching, creating friends, killing monsters, and tracking his prey - he cornered the gargoyle in a castle. After a short battle he was victorious and the head of the gargoyle serves as a dart board in his office.

Found in [[Dimension728]] on the planet [[Earth]]. In this dimension Victor has been blackmailed and somewhat made friends with [[The Squad]].

In an alternate timeline [[Dimension728B]] he has made enemies with the  [[HolyHunters]].
