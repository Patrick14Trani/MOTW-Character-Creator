# The Coldest Christmas

## Brainstorming
- Hereos are slowly introduced to who they are hunting.
- They are given the choice to hunt him or switch to another target.
- Having a problematic agent with them 

## The Hook
A wealthy organization ([[Fisher Price]]) has reached out to a monster hunting agency to hire a group of monster hunters to put a stop to a monster that threatens all of Christmas!

ooorrrr....

The group has passed a recent challenge that [[Fisher Price]] presented them and have been chosen for the special mission.

## The Session
### Intro: Arriving at [[Fisher Price HQ]]
Arriving at the HQ will result in a very serious escort into an underground facility. Walking through a series of halls and corridors they will eventually arrive at a viewing room looking over a large facility. 

The Room there are looking over is rather large and has a lot of individuals in lab coats running about. In the middle of the room is a large metal cirular device and around that are a group of hooded individuals drawing runes. On the far side is a red skinned humanoid in a suit ([[Demon]]), chained to a metal crucifix.
> This is our portal chamber... you have all been brought here to pull off possibly one of the greatest monster hunts on [[Earth]]. More information will be revealed to you about your target when you go through that portal... IF.. you go through that portal. I will be honest... this is extremely experimental and the odds of being able to come back are slim. But we will be doing the universe a service. That being said, if we do make it back the reward will be unsermountable. 
> If no. we will have you escorted from the premises and be on your way

With that quick sentiment.. the players must decide if they are willing to take the leap.
- If they say yes, perfect we can continue, Keep in mind we want to persuade them heavily to do the mission. If they have outstanding debt or beef with an organization it can be offered to have that removed. Otherwise fame, fortune, a new base addition or base in general. Travel to anywhere... etc..
- If they say no for some reason... then they will be removed from the premisses but on the way over a 
	- Before their memories can be wiped, [[Rick Sanchez]] will portal to them, blast the two agents and yell at you to hurry in. Alarms begin to blare!
		> RICK! you totally just killed thay guy!
		> Shut up Morty! Guys guys get in!! I accidentally forgot to switch to stun... This is the only way out!

		Skip to the where are we part!

### If they agreed!
The agent with you will speak into an earpiece and in will come in a couple of people. 
The first is [[Mary Weihnachten]] and she is followed by [[Agent Power Wheels]]. The original agent will then introduce the group and herself as [[Agent Imaginex]]. The Agents will leave for a quick second giving some roleplaying opportunity to interact with [[Mary Weihnachten]]. If they don't interact with her she'll start asking about them so they can introduce themselves a bit. 

Then the agents will come back after a bit and the playes will follow them out into the giant room. The cloaked individuals will be all be circled around the circle of runes. One will be standing waiting to greet the team and motion for them to enter the circle. Two lab coat individuals will begin to sprinkle dust around the edges while another two wheel the figure on the crucifx over. The lead man will draw a sacraficial dagger. With the go ahead the ritual will commence. If the players have any last statements or questions they can do so!

Big Magic Portal: You will go ahead and roll for the ritual casters:
- On a 12+:  They appear at the exit from the tunnels into the Workshop grounds
- On a 10+: They appear in a room near the exit
- On a 7-9: They appear in the torture chamber
- On a Fail: They appear on an ice slide down towards the waste disposal

### Where are we?
The players will portal into an icy cave (It will be part of a cave network under [[Santa's Workshop]]).
