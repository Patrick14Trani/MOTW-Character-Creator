## Lore
Fuck I wasn't listening. Really really big city. 


Something called [[Under Mountain]] and [[Halister Hold]].

People try to pilfer from the the mages under mountain but of course plenty of monsters reside there. People who survive the [[Under Mountain]] come back changed people. Whether that be for the better or worse

The city has a rather large military, and even a dragon defense system.
	Hippogrif riders, wall mounted balistas
> No dragons will be here ever, no dragons

There is also the city watch, and they have access to investigators and magistrates for looking into crime. They have a decent track record.

Order of Magists and Protectors: Forces the citizens to sign into this and basically anyone that has magic ability is registered and these people can be conscripted to help out with any situation that need be.

Massive statues all over the city. One is half sunked into the ground. They're beat up basically but huge and have some mystery behind them. The walking statues - apparently animtate and defend.

The [[Spell Plague]] shut down those robots by making them go a bit haywire. The city had to fight them.

We showed up 5 year laters....

## Places
[[The Yawning Portal]]: A massice tavern on the peak of a hill and on one side there is a 40ft diameter hole. Something is being contained down there, giant bucket thing sinks down there. Operated by a clay golumn.
