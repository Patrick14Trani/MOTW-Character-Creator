# Adastan
## *The Yellow Beast's prison*
## About
When the barriers fell around the land of the mountains, the yellow beast [[Lucas]] was trapped inside here. The land is the foothills of the [[Scarlet Mountains]] and is a very small country that works very closely with [[Irustan]]. In fact many times [[Irustan]] has argued that Adastan should just become a part of their country. 

The people of this country had no respect for their god and when time came, they ransacked his home and sought to harm him.

The smallest country on [[Hearth]].

## Locations
