base class: [[The Mundane]]

When **you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger**, roll +[[Charm]]. On a 10+ they’ll do what you say they should, no questions asked. On a 7-9 they do it, but [[the Keeper]] chooses one from:   - They ask you a hard question first.
  - They stall and dither a while.
  - They have a “better” idea.

On a miss, they’re going to think you’re crazy and maybe dangerous too.
