# Helper's Harbor
## [[The Pure]]'s forward base

## About
A large harbor located on the southeast side of [[South Dornam]]. It used to be under control of a large humanitarian survivor group known as [[The Helpers]]. However, when [[The Pure]] showed up in warships and began firing into the harbor, everyone was forced to flee into the surrounding fields where they would eventually become the victims of machine gun fire. Many other survivors would show up and attempt to escape the newly created field of zombies  but would be turned down at the harbor gates and consumed.

The pure use this as a scientific base to study the virus and send off scavenged supplies.
