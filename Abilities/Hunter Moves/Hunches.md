**When something bad is happening** (or just about to happen) somewhere that you aren’t, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+ you knew where you needed to go, just in time to get there. On a 7-9, you get there late—in time to intervene, but not prevent it altogether. On a miss, you get there just in time to be in trouble yourself.
