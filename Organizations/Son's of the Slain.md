### About
The Son's of the slain are a collection of several outcast groups who lost their families and friends to [[The Pure]].  They live in [[Son's Watch]] and look to overthrow the fortress that has become the harbor. Unfortunately other factions have the same idea and don't want to share the glory. They have come at odds especially with the [[Heroic Horde]].

They currently have much influence on [[South Dornam]], [[Zeneth]].
