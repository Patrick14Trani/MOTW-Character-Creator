# The Professional

> It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down monsters. Still, that’s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”

### What's Unique
- **Agency**: As a professional you obviously work for a monster hunting agency. You get to create that agency that your work for! Are they a black-budget government department, a secret military unit, a clandestine police team, a private individual’s crusade, a corporation, a scientific team, or what?

 	You get to choose two resources that your agency has and two things of red tape
	
- **Professional special**: When you spend a point of Luck, your next mission from the Agency comes with lots of Red Tape. Lots
