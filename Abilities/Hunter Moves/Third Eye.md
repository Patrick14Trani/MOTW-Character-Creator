When you **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 [[hold]] on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 [[hold]], but youâ€™re exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!
