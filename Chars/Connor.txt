Description: A young but tall boy. He has brown hair and glasses and tends to wear video game merch.

Background: A young boy in fact the youngest of 4. He is nearing his highschool life but is constantly
told that he is the chosen on by each member in his family. Yet he really just wants to game.

exp = [][][][][]

luck= [][][][][][][]

Moves:
    Destiny's Plaything: At the beginning of each
	mystery, roll +Weird to see what is revealed about
	your immediate future. On a 10+, the Keeper will
	reveal a useful detail about the coming mystery. On
	a 7-9 you get a vague hint about it. On a miss, something bad is going to happen to you.
    I'm here for a reason: : Thereâ€™s something you are
	destined to do. Work out the details with the Keeper,
	based on your fate. You cannot die until it comes
	to pass. If you die in play, then you must spend a
	Luck point. You will then, somehow, recover or be
	returned to life. Once your task is done (or you use
	up all your Luck), all bets are off.
    Devestating: When you inflict harm, you may inflict +1 harm.
