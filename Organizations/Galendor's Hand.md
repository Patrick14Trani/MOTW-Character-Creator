### About
Galendor's Hand was created by the legendary sorcerer [[Galendor]]. He was most notable for trapping the Black [[Colored Beast]] in an unknown location. He passed along the power of controlling the gods to a select few who ended up passing this knowledge around. Finally an order was created for mantaining this knowledge along with other magical things [[Galendor]] knew. 

The order came out of the Shadows in [[Irustan]] when they began to feel a distrubance in the magical balance of [[Hearth]]. With observance they saw that many of the colored beasts were unfit to rule, especially [[Ramu]]. They took special note to deal with him first and brutally since his actions against humankind were disgusting.

The feeling of unbalance grew more and more and they decided they must act before figuring out what is actually going on. The entire order gathered to attempt a speel Galendor had constructed for this very situation. They cast the walls of anti magic barring any creatures from passing through country boarders. The walls also sapped the magical energy of the gods constantly, preventing them from attempting to fight back. 

With the walls down, Galendor's hand must act quickly to figure out what is causing the unbalance before civil unrest and war breaks out over [[Hearth]]. The biggest unrest comes from [[Oramora]] and their ruler [[Yasmine]].
