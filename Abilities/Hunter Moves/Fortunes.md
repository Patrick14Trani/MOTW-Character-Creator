The Sect has ancient prophecies or divination techniques to predict the future. Once per mystery, you may use them. If **you look at what the future holds**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, you get bad information and the Keeper decides how that affects you. Spend your hold to:   - have a useful object ready.
  - be somewhere you are needed, just in time.
  - take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to another hunter.
  - retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesnâ€™t happen.
