Your touch can heal injury and disease. When you **lay your hands on someone hurt**, roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+, heal 2 [[harm]] or an illness, plus theyâ€™re stabilized. On a 7-9, you can heal the [[harm]] or illness as on a 10+, but you take it into yourself. On a miss, your aura causes them extra [[harm]].
