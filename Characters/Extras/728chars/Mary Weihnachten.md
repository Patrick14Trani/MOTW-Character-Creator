### Description
Mary is a tall german woman who is emphatuated with Christmans. She is always wearing an ugly christmas sweater,  an elf hat with a bell, cargo pants of some sort, and belled shoes. On her shoulder rests an elf on the shelf... no one realizes this but it communicated the lies and wrong doings

She has blonde hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin due to time spent in very cold places. Her demeanor is always pleasant. Her eyes seem allude that she is insane since they always seem to be a bit wide. 
### Notes
  Her family was extremely active in the [[Catholic Church]] and she loved Christmans. She loved going to mass but she also loved the idea of [[Santa Claus]]. She enjoyed spreading cheer and joy to those who deserved it and would ignore those who had been naughty. 

She became so emphatuated with christmas that she still believed in santa.
> Most conspiracy theorists are always trying to find the really basic and boring criptids or slander governmental bodies... I prefer to chase a truly unique being and discover how they rule.

She spent her free time looking at UFO pictures and bright lights in the sky. Many would take her for an alien nut, but she believed there was something greater to the UFO pictures especially around the christmas season. Years of observation led her to believe a small light would flash at the same time, place, and day in her home town. That day was Christmas and that light had to be the portal he came through. 

She is slandered by the cryptid community for her findings and no one believes her. One year on christmas she recieved an interesting package. Having no close family and friends she was confused and when she opened it she was greeted with an elf on the shelf... from a Kris Kringle. She smiled and vowed to keep his secret, but still study and hopefully one day be invited to the gates of his domain. 

Traveling the world she would find other creatures as well and she became an annoying asset to some monster hunting teams. She recieved weapons from santa for protection.
