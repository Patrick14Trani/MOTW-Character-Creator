### About
This guild of monster hunting is a black suite private business owned by Brick Boston, an unorthadox business man. His business exceeds in mystery cleanup and monster capture. Although killing is prohibited by employees, the hunters they sponsor are more than welcome to do as they wish. Due to the live capture rule for employees, they have a vast knowledge source on many monsters. 

Beaurcractic measures however, mean that getting needed support or items could take a while since a good amount of paperwork and review need to be signed off.

This organization has found itself to have operating outposts in most denny's.
