# Date Night Vampire

## Brainstorming
Is this Ready to play: **NO**
## The Hook
Several men and women have gone missing or have been found dead. The police were never able to solve the murders since they were distant from one another, however monster hunting P.I. [[Jessica Jones]] found the case files and bodies just in time to send out a distress call to nearby hunters. She is rather busy with another case.

The hunters will pickup where the police left off.
## The Monster 
- [[Vampire]]:  [[Brady]]
## Featured Characters
- [[Jessica Jones]]

## The Mystery
#### Intro
The Players will initially be brought into [[Jessica Jones]] place and specifically to her underground lab where she conducts autopsies. The players will be able to observe the two dead bodies found. one is a man and one is woman.

Evidence to be found on bodies: NOTE - The players should be able to learn, the location, create type, and possible abilities it has... players may do some cool things or have interesting ideas on evidence so improvisation may need to be used heavily.
- Both bodies have two small holes for wounds that are well hidden
- Both have magical traces on them. some investigation and knowledge of magic may reveal it to be a seduction spell. 
- The Man 
	- The man has a gunshot wound to the head
	- Red Hair on him
- The Woman
	- She has 3 gunshot wounds to the chest
	- purple hair on him

There are also case files to be looked over: 
- All victims last know locations were speed dating nights at restaraunts
- All victims had significant blood loss
- Both had unregistered or unknown DNA on their bodies.. whatever it is, its is humanoid and capable of mating with humans. The colored hair on them was different however meaning the culprit may change their appearance.
- The DNA was closely related to DNA found at archaelogical site from several years ago where corpses were discovered with stakes through their chests.
	- Further research on this from the players can reveal that several crypts were empty and some seemed to be missing or recently removed. Two workers were found dead with a good amount of blood drained from each of them.

The players after learning about the date nights will hopefully do some research and find out about the speed date night at [[Skaters]].  Otherwise [[Jessica Jones]] can offer some direction.

#### The Date Nights
[[Skaters]] is somewhat full for the event. The target being a vampire will bring suspicion on several pale individuals, however let it be reminded that makeup exists. The players can attempt to narrow down the heard however they like.

People Present
[[Brady]] Siggins: About 6ft

Jackson Rieger: around 7ft, in a green trenchcoat and has on a green leprecaun hat. Actually two [[The Fifth Leaf | Fifth Leaf]] members mucking about.

Tim Higgins: The Douche Chad... very toxic male typa guy. Would only approach female characters.
