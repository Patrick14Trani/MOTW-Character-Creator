## The Mystery
After a night on the cruise and partaking in whatever activities the players choose to do, a special banquet will begin. The banquet is to mark the entering of the bermuda triangle just put everyone in good spirits.

A heavy fog will role in and encompase the entire ship... A galleon will pull alongside the cruise ship and the hivemind will begin boarding. Very visible from the windows of the banquest room will be the ship, but soon those windows shattered as what appear to be undead pirates swing through.  Majority of the guests will be held captive in that room. Zombies will begin weeding through the crowd looking for something

Another detachment of zombies will be moving on the other side of the ship through rooms, grabbing people or random wealth items

A third detachment will be on the main deck preparing some sort of ritual

Players may be at a variety of locations and some may even end up captured. How they handle their situations is up to them. Until they prove a threat they will be treated as normal people.

### The Banquet Room
After plenty of weeding through passengers, a young teenage girl and (if one of your players is a truly good and innocent player then them{if their captured of course}) or an older man will be selected and begin to be dragged away to the deck. 

A large amount of zombies will be located here, not only for the searching but to the keep the people at bay and put down anyone who might start something.

### The Ritual
The ritual team will be a small group of zombies preparing two large runic symbols on the deck of the ship. 

Once their selections reach them, they will place them each in the middle of one of the runes. Then the blast of two cannons will be heard and boarding lines will launch their victims, tying the two ships "in blood". The runes will begin to glow... and the clock will begin to tick.
- at this time the players should make a weird check
	- Success: Your spirit remains strong
	- Mixed Success: Your fine for now (the boat holds 1 to make you do it again whenver)
	- Fail: You feel something deep inside you being tugged at. 
- spooks with spirit eyes will get bad eyes and eventually be able to see the spirits being pulled away
