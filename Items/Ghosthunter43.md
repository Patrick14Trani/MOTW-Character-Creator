# Ghosthunter43

## Lore
This gun can be found at the [[Shadow Falls Sanitarium]]. It was an item in testing that was hopeful to destroy *ghosts*. However it never got the chance to be tested. The belief was that the gathering of tons of troubled souls would draw out hauntings and the gun would get tons of testing done. Unfortunatly this was not the case, and it was left abandoned in a locked gun cabinent to gather dust. Then a day came and a real ghost was present and nobody remembered it was there.

The developing company was [[UCMG]].
