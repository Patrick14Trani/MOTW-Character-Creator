When **you make a showy entrance into a dangerous situation**, roll +Cool. On 10+ everyone stops to watch and listen until you finish your opening speech. On a 7-9, you pick one person or monster to stop, watch and listen until you finish talking. On a miss, youâ€™re marked as the biggest threat by all enemies who are present.
