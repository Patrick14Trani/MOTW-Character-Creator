### About
The Helpers were a faction that controlled [[Helper's Harbor]] on [[South Dornam]]. It was every survivors goal to reach the fabled Helpers and be able to live peacefully in the Harbor. The idea was that the people on [[Kyrde]] would be sending over supplies and The Helpers would be able to distribute these supplies as well as begin to create foundations to combat the [[Z-Virus]].  Majority of this group were people from [[Kyrde]] that wanted to help.

Unfortunately the locals of [[Kyrde]] had a different opinion and [[The Pure]] was sent to destroy the Helpers and take control of [[Helper's Harbor]].

They say the entirety of organization was wiped out but some are rumored to still be alive and kicked, doing all they can to help others. Other survivors probably joined in on other large factions that got created in hopes of getting revenge.
