You may **banish an unnatural creature from your presence**. Roll +[[Tough]]. On a 10+ it is banished. On a 7-9 it takes a little while for the banishing to take effect—the creature has time to make one or two actions. Either way, the banished creature is unharmed, and you have no control over where it goes. This move may be used on unnatural hunters (e.g. [[the Monstrous]]). On a miss, something is keeping it here. That’s bad.
