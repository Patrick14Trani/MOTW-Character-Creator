# Haunting of Shadow Falls
## Brainstorming
This will play like phasmophobia... the ghost.. [[revenant]]..

Is this ready to be played?: **Yes**

## The Hook
Locals of [[Shadow Falls]] have been reporting a haunting at the [[Shadow Falls Sanitarium]]. [[Blitz Co]] founder [[Victor Dandin]] has asked that you deal with the situation. He can't risk any of his troops on this one.

He recruited expert ghost hunter [[Shelly Vanders]] to get together a team. All member should at least come up with a way they know Shelly.

## The Monster
- [[Revenant Dave Vanders]] : A reanimated corpse wielding an assortment of weapons found off of guard bodies. 

## Featured Characters
- [[Victor Dandin]]: Owner of Blitz Co
- [[Shelly Vanders]]: Ghost Hunter Extrodanair
	- Has her ghost hunting van: Inside the van are several cases full of ghost hunting equiptment.

- The equipment: 
	Every player will receive a ghost hunting bag each equipped with. 
	- emf
	- thermo
	- camera
	- voice box
	- smudge stick / match
	- glowstick

In the van, there are sound sensors and motion detectors as well. Also some crucifixes. 

## Schedule
This mission doesn't really have a schedule. Instead this section will go over clues and such for the area. There will also be a sort of timer based on how long they are in there. The ghost will begin to prey on their fear if it displays. If 4 ghost events get triggered, the ghost will do a short hunt.

Once the players discover the ghost type, they can report this to Shelly or do their own research. She can reveal the clue about smudge sticks if not already known. 

Depending on what Shelly has found, she may not want to kill the ghost of her father. She will have to be convinced to help fight. 

The mission can start at [[Blitz Co]] where the squad all meets up and gets the quick downlow on the mission or it can start in the car with [[Shelly Vanders]].

#### Clues in each location / Ghost Events in each location
GH: At any point inside the sanitarium if the players say the name Bill Stringer. The ghost will appear behind the person and breathe on their neck. 

**The Bar**: Inside are members of [[UCMG]]. They will come over when Shelly goes to the rest room and request that you recover some things for them. One would be a tech weapon that is unstable and then also files on *Bill Stringer* (Victor Dandins Real name)

**Entrance/Lobby**: There are computers in the entrance. The power is off but the computers still have hardrives intact. From these hard drives some security footage can be accessed of several areas on the day of the break out. 
- Lobby: People screaming and running, guests getting trampled, guards attempting to fight inmates.
- Barracks: Guards being maimed by a ghastly corpse moving at insane speeds. Many attempting to open a gun cabinet.
- Morgue: A runic symbol scrawled on the ground and a good amount of blood present on the floor. GH - Viewing the Morgue will cause the lights to turn on in the Lobby... there is no power to the building.

**Medical Ward**: Scattered files, skeletons on gournies, and a very recent deceased individual. They were beaten to death by a blunt weapon. With them was ghost hunting equiptment and a camera. The camera will reveal a more brutal vision of their death.

If Shelly goes in here she will search for some files but reveal frustration when she doesn't find them. If pryed she'll reveal her father was in here, and she will want to visit the archives.

GH - Touching a dead body in here will result in the ghost appearing touching the same body and chattering as it raises a weapon to strike the player. As they react it will attempt to dissapear.

**Barracks**: A plethora of skeletons adorned in body armor. Weapons will be readily availible in here along with a locked cabinent of new age weapons. One looks kind of like the the ray gun from ghost busters. In fact on it is printed [[Ghosthunter43]]. 

The players may search the bodies for keys. It will take a decent amount of gross body searching to find one.

GH - Touching the cabinent will result in a ghost event of the Ghost standing among all the *now standing* skeletons. Then dissapearing.
	- Opening the cabinent will result in another ghost event. The ghost will grab whoever opened it and teleport them down to the archives... if this is the trigger for a ghost hunt it will attempt to hunt them down there.

**Cafeteria**: Another place seemingly chock full of corpses. Many of which appeared to be service people. The room is rather large and the kitchen in the back has a count of dull knives. 

GH - Walking into the kitchen will result in a knife beginning to float and if the player doesn't react it will launch at them.

**Morgue**: Arriving at the morgue will result in the door being creepily opened. This room is freezing. Like actually freezing, your breath can be seen as well as a large rune scrawled on the ground. The medical files for 'Dave Vanders' can be found as well as ancient texts on dark rituals.

Shelly will know exactly what happened. A dark revival ritual to summon someone back as a spirit. Basically *Big Magic*. She'll assume the ghost is her father and become overwhelmed with rage. If she hasn't been to the archives, she'll be storming off to them now.

Placing a camera in here will reveal ghost orbs back and bringing a ghost writing book will bring about some fun writings.

GH - Touching the rune on the ground will result in the ghost appearing in the middle of it, spasing out and flailing it's limbs.

**Room Block A**: This is the room block where Victor Dandin and all his cronies were. A small security room has some computers with security footage covering these rooms and meeting areas. Players will be able to see that a group of individuals were sneaking about with books and reading them and taking notes.

Players possibly affiliated with Blitz Co will be able to identify the face of a young [[Victor Dandin]]. He always had books about gargoyles. Shelly will be able to identify her father and see that he always had books about ghosts.

The rooms will have all have certain random things in them.. but 3 rooms have open doors. 
- Victor's room: Scrawlings on the wall. Several similiar to the one in the morgue.
- Dave Vanders room: pretty empty. a box of belongings as well as a note to his daughter.
- Bruce Jens: A journal open to most recent entries of the plan to break out and a small strange latin phrase which was part of the spell. 

**Room Block B**: Here seems to be setup like a small outpost. Tables, chairs, and beds are placed to be like walls and barricades near the entrance of the security room. Skeletons lay all over those walls and guns all around. However in the security room is another set of fresher dead bodies. These ones crawling with insects and still early decomposition. A talk box lays in the middle of them all and a camera setup not far way looks over them. One of them holds a key. The key reads, "GUN SAFE".

The camera reveals their gruesome deaths by the ghost.

**Library**: A very generic library. Many books are missing. Observant or curious players can find checkout records. They'll be able to see a multitude of dark arts books being approved and checked out by Bill Stringer(Victor Dandin's real name). A key (to the archives) can be found here as well.

Finding the key to archives will result in the ghost appearing and pointing out the door. 

**The Archives**: A locked door down an eerie flight of stairs. The door is steel. If unlocked the room will be quite large. Shelly will immediatly want to search for her fathers files. The player may have been requested to find files on another person.

Opening her father's file will result in a ghost event. The ghost will teleport there and reveal itself crying for a few seconds.

**Visting Room**: Nothing much to see here. The scuffle of a rat might freak a player out. Otherwise it is notably empty. Just chairs, the glass walls, and phones to talk to people on the other side.

GH: Talking into a phone fo rthe first time will result in a ghost scream.

**Rec Room**: In the Rec room are several billiards tables, a ping pong table, normal tables for board games. On one of the tables it looks like people were playing a roleplaying game. There is also a chess board set up ready to be played.  Sadly.. a dead body will be at the seat there on the black side of the chess board. A journal is in the hands of the dead person... are several words crossed out.
Demon, Banshee, Spirit are crossed out
Yuri, Wraith, Revenant, and poltergiest  all have question marks
A ouiji board can also be found on the game shelf.

GH: Playing a game will result in the ghost playing with the player. They are more than welcome to continue to the game. (Best of 5 sharp check? or other skill). Beating the ghost will count as 2 ghost events due to it being angry now.

**Medical Entrance**: Has several tanks of old gasoline. Otherwise quite empty and uneventful. 

**Observation Deck**: A journal can be found with notes on observations of Bill Springer and his group. They are snooping about and beginning to look suspicious.

**Generator Room**: An empty generator need some fuel to power up again. Power can be turned on to rooms. Powering on more than 5 rooms will blow out the generator and some time will be needed to attempt to repair it. Noel has the tools in her van.
