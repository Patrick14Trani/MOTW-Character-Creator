# The Shadow
## Evil born in the dark

Shadows are creatures born in the darkness off of the negativity of others. They are nocturnal creatures that hunt only in the dark. They are ghost like in manor and can give off ghost clues. They even will only haunt their born location which depending on the power of the spirit, can increase the size of its territory
  
**Motivation:** 
They are somewhat primal creatures that have a hunger to kill but they also have a peculiarity of who they kill. They are born on negativity and that sort of feeds them, so they gun it for positive individuals who seem to know no fear.
