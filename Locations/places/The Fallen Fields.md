# The Fallen Fields
## The Wall of Horror

## About
This is the biggest zombie gathering on [[Zeneth]]. The fallen fields are the area surrounding the [[Helper's Harbor]] on [[South Dornam]].  This field was given its name for the hundreds of thousands that [[The Pure]] gunned down because they were unsure of who was infected and who wasn't. They utilize this wall of zombies to discourage other survivors from approaching the harbors. 

The event of the great killing scarred all survivors and drew hatred for [[The Pure]] and the lands they came from. 

The place serves as a breeding ground for zombie mutations and often [[The Pure]] use this land to study the [[Z-Virus]].
