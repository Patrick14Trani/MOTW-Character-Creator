# The Flake

> Everything’s connected. But not everyone can see the patterns, and most people don’t even look that hard. But me, I can never stop looking deeper. I can never stop seeing the truth. I spot the patterns. That’s how I found the monsters, and that’s how I help kill them.

### What's Unique
- **Flake special**: When you spend a point of Luck, pick an aspect of the current situation. The Keeper will tell you what other conspiracies that aspect connects to.
