base class: [[The Hex]]

When you apply your will to dispelling a magical effect, blocking a spell, or suspending a Phenomenon, roll +[[Weird]]. On a hit, momentary magics are cancelled completely, and long-lasting spells and effects are suspended temporarily. On a 10+, you can also spend [[Luck]] to instantly snuff out a powerful spell or strange effect. On a 7-9, you take 1-[[harm]] as the strain of dismissing [[magic]] unravels you.
