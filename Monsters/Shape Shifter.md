# Shapeshifter    
  
**About:** Known tricksters and cheats. These creatures love to lurk and observe. They have no qualms over who or what they kill, they are in it for the experience. The more a shapeshifter has killed of a certain species, the better they can replicate them. In their natural form they are a slender bipedal creature that stand around 6'5" feet tall. Their skin is shiny, grey, and very smooth. Their fingers are long and sharp allowing them to quickly slice and impale their prey. Their eyes are as black as a void. They can transform near instantly and into creatures up to double their size. Transforming gives them the physical propeties and abilities that their form takes.  
  
**Motivation:** The shapeshifters specifically at this party yearn for human blood. It was the first or second thing they tasted. They found themselves at a college town and discovered that drunk college students make for suitable and satiable targets.   
  
**Abilities/Actions/Attacks:**  
 - Harm : 8  
 - Transform : Immedialtly take on the form of a once consumed creature. Cannot be more that double the size of orignal form. Once transformed, you inherit all the physical abilities of your new form.  
 - Rake: A swiping blow with their natural hands. 3-harm bleeding  
  
**Vurnerabilities**:  
- They are not armored or magically protected in anyway. Weapons effect them just as they would any other human  
- When transformed they obviously also inherit the weaknesses of the form they take on
