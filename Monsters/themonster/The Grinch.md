Dimension: [[The North Pole]]

#### Notes:
The Grinch is a [[Grinch]] currently stationed in [[The North Pole]]. He is waging an everlasting war with [[Santa Claus]] and every year that christmas has occurred, he has lost. The most recent year was to be different but he lost his spy and now yearns to bring the war to an end. He wants his spy back above all else.

He is a magical being that can use magic quite efficently. His troops on the other hand rely on their weapons. 

Harm = 0 / 8


His Abilities:
**Teleport**: In reaction to an attack, he may teleport to a previously places totem. This grinch has placed his totem within 4 seperate pillars in his bunker throne room. 

**Spirit Crush**: A magical attack. The targeted player begins to feel, specifically holiday memories dissapate from their mind. This attack is purely a roleplay attack, it does no harm. 

The player must make a use magic roll and fully succeed to ward off the the attack. The grinch need not maintain focus on that player for the attack to be upheld. If two turns pass and no check is made or the grinch hasn't been killed, the player will fully forget christmas. 

**Swipe**: A physical attack that does 2-harm and causes bleeding.
