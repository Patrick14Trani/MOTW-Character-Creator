### Description
Only ever goes out in public wearing fortnite cosplay. No one knows their face. Their mask is magically bound to their face as well.

Underneath the disguise is a 18 year old girl who has seen way to much for her age. She has long brown hair. Her right eye is blue and her left is yellow. She stands at 5'4". 
### Notes
  She was a twitch streamer who played a ridiculous amount of fortnite and when ninja dropped the ball, she picked up some up some those followers. She got really into the lore when Fortnite had the alien themed plot and she went out and got into researching aliens and coming up with all this ridiculous content for her young followers. Littel did she know, she was actually onto something with real aliens and found herself on their operating table one night.
  
  Some quick experiments led to the creation of Orange Justice. She quickly had to adapt to her new magical powers. She wants to meet them again because she can't seem to see them in all her memories.
  
  The missing people around the date nights in [[Missouri City]] have led Orange to believe that aliens are behind it.
