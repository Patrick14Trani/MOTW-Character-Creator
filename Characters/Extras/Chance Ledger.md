Chance Ledger awoke from nightmares and visions of the apocolypse one day and went outside his farm to see fires and smoke erupting from the nearby towns on the horizon. Over the next couple of days he would get visions of a bridge, of zombies, of horrific deaths, and leading people.. he felt a calling to save people and his life as a chosen began.

His farm was unbothered and it took a while before he saw his first zombie. It made for the ideal safe zone and as more and more people were saved, walls were erected and other ammenities were eventually established. The farm became a fort and he named it after his grandfather. [[Fort Sigmund]] will serve as his base of operations and he now prepares for a journey south to get his people to safety.
