# Shadow Falls Sanitarium
## House of the Darkest Minds

## About
This was one of the last remaining sanitariums still in use. It was used by the government of the [[USA]] to detain individuals speaking about things that could really upset the public. Many of the inmates were victims of monster attacks before mind whiping tech was created. Unfortunately, due to large incident resulting in most present personel being brutally murdered and many inmates escaping, the Sanitarium still remains closed. However, locals say the place is haunted and several dissapearances happen year round.

## Other Notes
The hauting is from the [[Revenant Dave Vanders]] who was created by [[Victor Dandin]] and his associates. If revealed to the general public, this would tear down Blitz Co. If revealed to another Monster Hunting Agency, Blitz Co will lose considerably funding and respect from the monster hunting community.
