You have a mentor in the Sect: name them. When you **contact your mentor for info**, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+, you get an answer to your question, no problem. On a 7-9 you choose: they’re either busy and can’t help, or they answer the question but you owe a favour. On a miss, your question causes trouble.
