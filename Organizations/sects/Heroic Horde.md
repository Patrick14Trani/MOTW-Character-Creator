### About
The Heroic Horde are a religious cult who see zombification as a religous process meant for the wicked. They spread the idea of cleansing the evil and giving them "new life". Their deepest members are looking for a way to create the [[Z-Virus]]. They will stop at nothing to spread their belief and especially wipe out [[The Pure]] for they are the definition of blasphemy.

They currently are at odds with [[Son's of the Slain]] due to the fact that they both wish for control of the same port.

They don't specifically have one base but rather several locations around [[South Dornam]], [[Zeneth]].
