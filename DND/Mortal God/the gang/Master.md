# Master
[[Mortal  Gods]]
## Backstory
So my spirit is the spirit of an old Monk was so powerful and masterful in his ways that he too was revered as a god as was kind of given his own holy temple where he would mediate. Once he passed it became a tradition to make pilgrimage to this temple and meditate, pray, etc... His spirit watched over the those who journeyed and it was legend that he protected the travelers, which was true to an extent. Although I never really manifested or intervened I did watch over those who journied and maybe gave a bit of strength or guidance to some. One year however there was a royal amongst the group of pilgrims who was disturbing everyone and harassing people, just being a real dick to everyone. He wanted to buy out the temple and turn it into a get away for the rich and powerful. He is the one I decided to intervene with and take over his body. I called off his people and now it is my goal to show this mortal what a humble life is like and force them to do relative good and understand suffering. Basically humble this person and hopefully turn them gooood maybe, a definite positive if it happens but not a main objective.

## Drunken Master Perks
Flurry of blows gets allows to me to dissengage and move another 10feet until the end of the turn

-   **Leap to Your Feet.** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

-   **Redirect Attack.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

### Drunkard's Luck
Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

### Intoxicated Frenzy
At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.
