# Colored Beast
## Description
These beast are godlike creatures on the planet [[Hearth]]. They are each unique in coloring and identity. Their colors are quite bright and each of the creatures has a pair of feathery wings. However they are still humanoid beings that are a bit larger than humans. Of course each is their own and they all differ in size and body type. They all have catlike eyes.

Before the barriers fell over their lands they each were quite atune with a specific type of magic as well as the ability to fly.
