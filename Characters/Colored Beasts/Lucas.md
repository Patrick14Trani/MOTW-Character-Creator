# Lucas

## Description
Lucas is the smallest of the group, somewhat of the child. He shines a vibrant yellow that is near impossible to miss

## Background
The yellow [[Colored Beast]] and supposed god over the peole of [[Adastan]]. Lucas often instead of being around his people would be tailing [[Ramu]]. He would help him consume some of his sacrafices and although he didn't agree with Ramu's way of leading, he didn't know any better himself

Since he was younger looking, Lucas was well loved by kids. Unfortanely adults saw no merit in this. Lucas secretly was very close to one child that lived in a small hut in the [[Bleeding Hills]]. 

After the walls fell Lucas was trapped and imprisoned by [[Galendor's Hand]].
