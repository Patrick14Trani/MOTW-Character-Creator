You have set up a haven, a safe place to work. Pick three of the options below for your haven:

- **Lore Library**. When you hit the books, take +1 [[forward]] to **investigate the mystery** (as long as historical or reference works are appropriate).
- **Mystical Library**. If you use your library’s occult tomes and grimoires, preparing with your tomes and grimoires, take +1 [[forward]] for **[[Use Magic]]**.
- **Protection Spells**. Your haven is safe from [[monsters]]—they cannot enter. [[Monsters]] might be able to do something special to evade the wards, but not easily.
- **Armory**. You have a stockpile of mystical and rare monster-killing [[weapons]] and items. If you **need a special weapon**, roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ you have it (and plenty if that matters). On a 7-9 you have it, but only the minimum. On a miss, you’ve got the wrong thing.
- **Infirmary**. You can heal people, and have the space for one or two to recuperate. [[The Keeper]] will tell you how long any patient’s recovery is likely to take, and if you need extra supplies or help.
- **Workshop**. You have a space for building and repairing guns, cars and other gadgets. Work out with [[the Keeper]] how long any repair or construction will take, and if you need extra supplies or help.
- **Oubliette**. This room is isolated from every kind of monster, spirit and [[magic]] that you know about. Anything you stash in there can’t be found, can’t do any [[magic]], and can’t get out.
- **Panic Room**. This has essential supplies and is protected by normal and mystical means. You can hide out there for a few days, safe from pretty much anything.
- **Magical Laboratory**. You have a mystical lab with all kinds of [[Weird]] ingredients and tools [[useful]] for casting spells (like the **[[Use Magic]]** move, [[Big Magic]], and any other magical [[moves]]).
