A group of Divine Warriors that investigate demonic actions in heaven. Demons constantly break and enter as well as attempt to kidnap and harvest souls of the saved. This is the group [[Nova]] was a part of before her unfortunate accident. Although they tend to banish those who break the rules, they have a bounty specifically on Nova if she were to ever show her face again.
