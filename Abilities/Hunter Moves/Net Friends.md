You know a lot of people on the Internet. When **you** **contact a net friend to help you** with a mystery, roll +[[Charm]]. On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information. On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. On a miss, you burn some bridges.
