You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. **When you do first aid**, roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 [[harm]]. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 [[harm]] or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 [[harm]]. This move takes the place of regular first aid.
