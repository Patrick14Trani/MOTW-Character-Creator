When you ask a suspect leading questions, roll +[[Charm]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 2, on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1, on a miss [[hold]] 1 but something bad is going to happen too.
Spend your [[hold]] to ask questions from this list:

-  One question from the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** list.

-  Was that a lie?

-  What is something you left out that you didnâ€™t want me to notice?

-  Are you complicit with any [[ongoing]] criminal activity?

-  Did you commit this specific crime?
