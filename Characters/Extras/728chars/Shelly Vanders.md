### Notes
Shelly grew up in small family. She was an only child and lived with her parents. One day, her father and her witnessed the death of her mother. She was murdered by a strange man covered in symbols and who wielded a rather strange dagger. The man was conducting a ritual as he was shot by Shelly's father. Shelly was intrigued by the blade that killed her mother. 

She began research on the symbols and blade and fell down the rabit hole of dark arts, mystic practices, and devil rituals. Soon after her father began to awake screaming in the night declaring that his dead wife was haunting him.

Eventually he was deemed unfit to take care of a child and was taken to [[Shadow Falls Sanitarium]]. Shelly was taken into an orphanage, but would often ask to stop by her old house when on walks as it wasn't far away. She too would see the ghostly apparition of her mother in the windows or out on the porch. 

No one would adopt her. She was considered insane by her protectors and the other children around. Eventually she broke free from the orphanage and escaped to her home where she recovered her belongings and found her ghostly mother. Shelly however wasn't there for saying goodbyes or even trying to dispell the curse on her mother's soul, no, she sought knowledge. Her mother's ghost appeared to understand and showed her rune symbols and then signaled at the dagger. Shelly understood and drew blood and spilled it onto the rune. There was a blinding red flash and then the blood began to move around the room outlined everything that was happening years ago (like a hologram but blood). She learned everything there was to about ghosts, magic, and rituals. The cultists of the past that had murdered her mother were able to teach so much...

And with that she went to tell her father he was right however, that's when the outbreak happened. That's when the news came on about the inmates breaking out and killing majority of the staff. Governemnt officials were working hard to track down the insane and bring them to justice. Then the dissapearances started happening. She had since put several ghosts to rest... it was time to see what needed to be done and finally figure out what happened to her father.
