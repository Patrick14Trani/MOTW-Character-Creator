### About
This organization is run by demons and keeps a natural order to the demon nation. They investigate human sightings when they can, but are currently focused on the war on Satanism. This group is a branch of the [[Demonia]] government.

> Satanism is an araeic value set from demons. Yes he exists but killing eachother and making sacrafices are no longer the way he wants things. We litterally have a portal to hell. Stop bringing this across the border, it has no place in monster society.
