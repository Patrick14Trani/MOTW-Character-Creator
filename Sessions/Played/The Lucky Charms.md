## Clues / Encounters
When engaging a sus looking individual. They will ask why you are bothering them. When attempting to get information out of them, they will reveal they are apart of the [[The Fifth Leaf]] and they will never talk and then they'll try to fight back or kill themself.

*Also note that each sus individual is 3 leprechauns stacked on one another and covered in a bright green trenchcoat.*

If you do successfully charm or magically bind them you'll have a better chance at getting to them. Giving them coins will momentarily drop all their guards and you can ask them whatever. If another leprechaun witnesses them giving away information, it will kill them.
