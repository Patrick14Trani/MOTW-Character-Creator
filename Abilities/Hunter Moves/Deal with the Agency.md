When you requesting help or [[gear]], or making excuses for a failure, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for [[gear]] or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.
