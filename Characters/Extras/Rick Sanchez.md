### Description
- Rick is an extremely intelligent and experienced individual. He goes on crazy adventures with his buddy [[Morty]]. They don't necessarily fight monsters or that isn't their goal, but their tales tend to get them on the receiving end of violence. 
- One of his current experiments is playing god to [[Dimension728]] by having tricked [[Chad Strappington]] into thinking he is a chosen.
