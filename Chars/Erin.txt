Moves:
    I've Read About This: Roll +Sharp instead of +Cool when you act under pressure.
    Preparedness: : When you need something unusual
	or rare, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you have it here right
	now. On a 7-9 you have it, but not here: it will take
	some time to get it. On a miss, you know where it is,
	but itâ€™s somewhere real bad.
