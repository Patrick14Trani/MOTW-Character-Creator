### About
Fischer Price is the conquering toy development company for infants and toddlers. They know all of which goes on and when monster interfeared with supply chain once and the company was confronted by the [[UCMG]] they paid and invested in their own division of monster hunting. They specifically dived into this new world to find threats to their profits and sure enough when they fell upon [[Mary Weihnachten]]'s  work they had put a ton of money into researching it themselves and they discovered she was right.

One of their big missions is to take down santa so that their profits can increase more.
