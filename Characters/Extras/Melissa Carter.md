Melissa Carter found herself trapped with a strange apparition on her shoulder since she was a young child. It would cause her to see things, attack others, and often after attacking it would make her feel extremely horrible about it. 

She soon began to cope with the being and could easily deny it. She learned to control it and soon found out she had magical capabilites. Which were perfect when the apocalypse broke out.

She was alraedy off on her own in small manor on the side of a mountain, [[Fort Skyhaven]]. When people began to show up she invited them in to form a safe group. She kept the group small since she didn't want to end up hurting a lot of people and she needed individuals who would follow the orders she to followed from her being. The group was soon known as the [[Sky Warriors]].  Her orders come rarely, but they are often he just dishing out what her ghost tells her to do.
