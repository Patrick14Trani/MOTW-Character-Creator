You can encourage coincidences to occur, the way you want. **When you jinx a target**, roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 2 and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1. On a miss, [[the Keeper]] holds 2 over you to be used in the same way. Spend your [[hold]] to:   - Interfere with a hunter, giving them -1 [[forward]].
  - Help a hunter, giving them +1 [[forward]], by interfering with their enemy.
  - Interfere with what a monster, minion, or bystander is trying to do.
  - Inflict 1-[[harm]] on the target due to an accident.
  - The target finds something you left for them.
  - The target loses something that you will soon find.
