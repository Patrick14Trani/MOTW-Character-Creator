# Zombie
  
**About:** 
Zombies are undead beings that are quite mindless. With varying forms and varying strengths and sizes, they are considered one of the biggest threats to human existence. One bite from one can send a living organism on the path to becoming just another walker in the horde. 

Their bodies are decaying seemingly weak for the most part. Special kinds of zombies will have certain strengths and abilities not described here.

 Zombies tend to have a horde like presence.
**Motivation:** 
Consume the living, turn everyone into one of them.
  
**Abilities/Actions/Attacks:**  
Normally they keep going until their head is crushed. They feel no pain

Infectious Bite: The suvivor should act under pressure to attempt a dodge. A full success is a dodge. A mixed success results in 1 harm. A fail results in a succesful bite and 2 harm. The player is now on the path to becoming a zombie unless a cure has been created. 
  
**Vulnerabilities**:  
Successful attacks, specifically aimed at the head will drop these guys. They don't have harm or anything.
