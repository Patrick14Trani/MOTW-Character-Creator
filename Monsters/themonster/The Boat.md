# The Boat
> I am all and all are me... soon you too will be with all... Imortality

## *It that consumes*
Monster type: N/A
Campaign: [[A Sinking Feeling]]
Beaten By: 
Dimension: 

#### Notes:
The Boat is an aged being of pure magic and mayhem. Birthed by the chaos of the [[Bermuda Triangle]], the Boat has been taking the souls of others since it came about. It feasts upon the majority of captured souls to maintain its power and satiate its hunger. Whatever is leftover is linked into its hivemind network of immortal zombies. 

The boat itselt is a spanish Galleon that has become inhabited by this being. It has grown immensly inside the ship. Its flesh binding to the boarding and its innards eventually becoming strung about the lower decks to make it so that the boat itself is the body. One would say that it is a living, breathing, thinking, and seemingly all knowing vessel. 
#### Weaknesses
Once on the boat, going below deck would reveal the large masses, organs, etc.
A lot of what the boat does requires sacrafice, power from souls, and basically just magic.
Being a boat, it cannot board any ships or perform many actions to actually harm the players itself
A wooden boat is vurnerable to fire
It can only see what its army sees theoretically. It can however use a magical form of echo location to navigate itself through the water
#### Abilities and Perks
It has a hivemind of soul captured zombies from all sorts of eras. Some actualy pirates, some soldiers, many vacations.. maybe even Amelia Airheart.. These zombies are also immortal, and dismembering them will only make them useless

Canon Fire : The boat can fire all of its broadsides as an attack and reload as another action. The flesh / muscle bound to canons allows it to do this without any crew

Soul Steal : Utilizing the hivemind, the boat will take over target ships and begin the soul steal ritual
 this requires
 - The Blood of the innocent
 - Beings with souls

Foggy Atmosphere : To conceal itself, it always moves in a dense fog magically generated and upkept


#### Underlings
[[Zombie]]s : However not the generic take on them. These "zombies" are more of a hivemind that are linked to the Boat. One becomes linked when their soul is stolen by the boat but not consumed. These zombies can be dismembered but not killed.

(Players should specify where they are attacking)
