# The Monsterous

> I feel the hunger, the lust to destroy. But I fight it: I never give in. I’m not human any more, not really, but I have to protect those who still are. That way I can tell myself I’m different to the other monsters. Sometimes I can even believe it.

### What's Unique
- **Monster Breed**: You are half human and half monster! Come up with the backstory on how you became that way, or maybe you always were like that. Did you change sides or were you always good? What kind of monster are you?
- **Curse**: You must pick one curse
- **Natural Attack**: You get to create the way that your fight with your monstrous form.
- **Monstrous special**: When you spend a point of Luck, your monster side gains power: your Curse may become stronger, or another Breed disadvantage may manifest.
