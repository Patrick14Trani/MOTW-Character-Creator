## *Hate those you can't see*
## About
South Dornam is a current war torn land of [[Z-Virus]] chaos. Factions of survivors exist across the lands and tend to pledge their allegiance to one of the two big factions. They are [[Son's of the Slain]] and [[Heroic Horde]]. Both factions have a strong distaste for the [[The Pure]] who have several outposts scattered secretly around for looting and dealing with unwanted targets.

There is a large harbor used by [[The Pure]] to move supplies to and from their home land.

This is the largest landmass on [[Zeneth]].
