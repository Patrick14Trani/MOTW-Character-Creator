### About
These are the 9 richest individuals on [[Kyrde]] that created [[The Pure]]. They pull all the strings for the actions that occur in [[Utopia]].  They official ideal which they hide from the population are that they wish to abandone everyone. They want to take over other planets that are better off than they are and they want to threaten those planets with the [[Z-Virus]]. Or they want to sell the [[Z-Virus]] for the money to live elsewhere. They hate [[Zeneth]] and resent the multitude of lowly individuals which is why they wish to sacrafice them all for the sake of discovering how the virus works.
