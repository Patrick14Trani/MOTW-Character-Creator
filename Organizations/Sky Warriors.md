### About
The Sky Warriors are a somewhat timid raiding group. They hide in the mountains of [[North Dornam]] and have a perfect view of [[The Crossing]]. Often they will lay traps for those who are attempting to cross to the south. 

Their fort, [[Fort Skyhaven]] is near impossible to breach but it's vantage point would make it the target of enemies if they had any. They live in near freezing conditions and do everything they can to stay warm. 

The group itself is quite small and secretive. They don't trust easily and only really accept new members after they have lost one of their own. The leader [[Melissa Carter]] is mysterious herself and often communicates her goals in peculiar ways.
