**At the start of each mystery**, roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+, you get a detailed vision of something bad that is yet to happen. You take +1 [[forward]] to prevent it coming true, and mark experience if you stop it. On a 7-9+ you get clouded images of something bad that is yet to happen: mark experience if you stop it. On a miss, you get a vision of something bad happening to you and [[the Keeper]] holds 3, to be spent one-for-one as penalties to rolls you make.
