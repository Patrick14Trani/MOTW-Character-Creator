You dabbled in the worst sort of mystical arts before you became one of the good guys. If **you trawl through your memories** for something relevant to the case at [[hand]], roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ ask [[the Keeper]] two questions from the list below. On a 7-9 ask one. On a miss, you can ask a question anyway but that will mean you were personally complicit in creating the situation you are now dealing with. The questions are:   - *When I dealt with this creature (or one of its kind), what did I learn?*
  - *What black [[magic]] do I know that could help here?*
  - *Do I know anyone who might be behind this?*
  - *Who do I know who can help us right now?*
