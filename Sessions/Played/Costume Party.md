# Costume Party
**Ready to Play?: YES**
## Hook
Players all summoned to a party by [[Noel]], a sorotity member of Lambda Lambda Lambda. She is scared that another one of the members is doing something to the rest of them. 

She missed the last sorority trip to Orange Beach and the group came back with one less person. Not to mention members have sort of just dissapeared throughout the year from several sororities. She suspects foul play.

She herself is aware of the monsters in the world and due to it being Halloween, is sort of scared that maybe one of them is a monster and that this party is going to turn out like a horror movie.

## Monster
[[Shape Shifter]]

## Characters
- [[Noel]] - Your informant and ally. She's looking for protection and help

Characters that are not a part of the sorority but can be helpful

## Key Events
- Rick and Morty Stealing Chad: This is really just an easter egg. Rick is too powerful and if chased or annoyed he'll just teleport whoever to the backyard.

- Corn Hole Game: Players could convince it to be doubles and someone be on brads team and another on Amy's. 

- Beer Pong Tournament: Brad starts a beer pong tournament. Players can participate in the tournament and will get a good realization that Brad goes off elsewhere

- Dance tournament: The couples will have a dance battle. Players are more than welcome to grab a partner and partake. They will see Amy and Susan go off upstairs.

- Brelinda: If the players follow Berlinda or stay with her, or grab the dogs attention she will be safe. She may approach whatever PC and ask why people like partie. If they inspire confidence in her she'll go to the living room and be safe. The dog will continue on its path. **If she dies** - Her body will be horrifically slashed and bites will be take out of her body. Evidence is very scarce. Just large open wounds. Looking back in time would reveal the Berlinda going to grab the ball Lanie's room and then a creature coming in behind her and murdering her, eating her a bit, then stashing her body. Possibly getting evidence off her body would be like saliva DNA, and grey skin under her fingernails. She also has dog fur on her. Also covered in dog hair.

- Marge Death: The dog has befriended her and the party kicks off and she really wants to get out so she goes outside and the dog follows. She does and sits down with her legs hanging off the poarch. The dog goes down into the yard below. Transforms and pulls her down below. Quickly silences and kills her and drags the body around the side. Her body is near hidden. It almost looks like a prop with its leg sticking out. 

- Rando's Death: The cat has lured someone outside. Could be a random guest, could be a player. It brings them out behind the tree and murders them. If it is a player the cat will be wary. It can sense the situation. It will go to lock the door first and then try and lure the player out to the tree or watch the player.

- Brad finding Berlinda body:  If the player's haven't already Brad will find the body and text Noel, She will go from the basement or wherever to the living grabbing whatever hunters she can. 

- Neville's Explosion: If the players have not put a stop to his experiment, it will explode.

- Patricia Under Attack: The cat comes in a low window to the basement towards the end. She is hammered and has no response to it transforming. This only happens if players haven't done anything about her being drunk.

- Amy and Susan Under Attack: The dog climbs up the side of the building and enters into Amy's room as she and susan are getting it on. Also at the same time of the explosion so players may or may not hear their screams.
