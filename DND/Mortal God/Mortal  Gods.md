# Mortal Gods
## About
A campaign where some gods have inherited some mortal bodies and are about to reak havoc. Happening in the [[Dimension562]].

We all meet eachother in Waterdeep by destiny and we show up at the same location. 

## My Notes
The world looks way different than what it used to be.

The [[Island of Shult]] is a new thing. The center of the continent is now flat and dead, done by the blue fire. Otherwise this whole plane of existence was crazy different before.

An interesting man with eye tattoos is moving about looking for someone
He is now announcing himself and being a viscuous and slaps a half orc... they have beef. 

Durnen and Bonnie work at the [[The Yawning Portal]].
