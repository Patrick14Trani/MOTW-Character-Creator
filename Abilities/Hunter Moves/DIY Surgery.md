When **you do quick and dirty first aid on someone** (including yourself), roll +Cool. On a 10+ it’s all good, it counts as normal first aid, plus stabilize the injury and heal 1 harm. On a 7-9 it counts as normal first aid, plus one of these, your choice:   - Stabilise the injury but the patient takes -1 forward.
  - Heal 1-harm and stabilise for now, but it will return as 2-harm and become unstable again later.
  - Heal 1-harm and stabilise but the patient takes -1 ongoing until it’s fixed properly.
