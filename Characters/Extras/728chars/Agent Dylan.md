### Description
A fun lighthearted individual. The rules and procedures of his company don't hold him back and he does what he can to support the players. However, if the players fail - he will be held accountable. Too many times and he may get fired.
### Notes
An agent working for the [[UCMG]]. He works closely with third party hunting groups, providing ground support as well as information to agents when they need it. He is based in [[Massachusetts]] and is close to retirement.

In one of his, surely, final escapades. He requisitioned a helicopter for the [[HolyHunters]] in [[Holly Bluff]] and attacked the [[The Fifth Leaf]].
